Given the current advances in the areas of artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and computer vision, automation of visual quality control is possible and can be a reliable solution. Current methods that achieve state-of-the-art anomaly detection results often use features of different scales extracted from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN). We propose employing multiple feature sets of the same scale alongside a normalizing ﬂow model designed speciﬁcally for such sets. Such input features allow the creation of signiﬁcantly smaller ﬂow models with faster inference. We managed to achieve a decrease of up to 77.5% in the number of ﬂow model parameters and 63.6% in inference time while still accomplishing results better than all other ﬂow models and all but one non-ﬂow method. Experimental evaluation on publicly available MVTec AD and MTD datasets showed a state-of-the-art level of performance of our models, thus proving that it is not necessary to use different scales to detect anomalies of different sizes. This research paves the way for real-time, efﬁcient AI-based automation of visual inspection.","2024-02-23","2024-03-02 10:16:16","2025-06-06 15:36:27","2024-03-02 10:16:16","","","","","","Appl Intell","FRAnomaly","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Really interesting and well explained paper.

Building such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the fact that a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed, few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically, MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps. Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensive empirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant dataset demonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods.","2018-11-19","2024-03-02 10:29:12","2025-06-06 16:46:04","2024-03-02 10:29:12","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:1811.08055 [cs, stat]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Fault classification is done by ranking anomalies and identifying which time series has the highest anomaly score</p> </div>","/Users/Adri/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-adria.molero@upc.edu/Mi unidad/Zotero/storage/ZKBDNAEE/Zhang et al. - 2018 - A Deep Neural Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Det.pdf; /Users/Adri/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-adria.molero@upc.edu/Mi unidad/Zotero/storage/ZAXTGWWN/1811.html; ","notion://www.notion.so/Zhang-et-al-2018-37fab1c18b3b4103991759537fde5d7d","2D input; Anomaly detection; Anomaly Score: Static; Autoencoder; Classified; Deep Learning; Ensemble (CNN + Attention + LSTM); Fault classification; High rated; Multivariate; notion; Output residuals; Power plant; Read; Reconstruction; RPlan: A; Single entity; U-net","Computer Science - Machine Learning; Statistics - Machine Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv:1811.08055","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide a fault anomaly detection technique based on distillation learning to address this issue. Two Vision Transformer (ViT) models are specif­ ically used in the distillation learning process, one of which serves as the teacher network and the other as the student network. By using a small-scale student network model, the computational efficiency of the model is increased without sacrificing model accuracy. For feature-centered representation, new loss and anomaly score functions are created, and an enhanced Transformer encoder with the residual block is proposed. Then, a rolling bearing dynamics simulation method is used to obtain rich fault sample data, and the pre-training of the teacher network is completed. For anomaly detection, the training of the student network is completed based on the proposed loss function and the pre-trained teacher network, using only the vibration acceleration samples ob­ tained from the normal state. Finally, the trained completed network and the designed anomaly score function are used to achieve the anomaly detection of rolling bearing faults. The experimental validation was carried out on two sets of test data and one set of real vibration data of a whole aero-engine, and the detection accuracy reached 100 %.

However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders’ ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, X = LD + S, where LD can be e ectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and S contains the outliers and noise in the original data X . Since such spli ing increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a “Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)”. Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such “Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)” give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.","2017-08-04","2024-03-07 17:47:29","2025-06-06 16:50:01","2024-03-07 17:47:29","665-674","","","","","","","","","","","ACM","Halifax NS Canada","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Dissertation on training Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection.

In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the ﬁrst and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The beneﬁts of the algorithm are veriﬁed on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load proﬁles. These proﬁles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66% in the ﬁnal test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.","2020","2024-03-06 13:06:05","2025-06-06 16:50:35","2024-03-06 13:06:05","1-1","","","","","IEEE Trans.

Based on the limited sample data, the principle of the approach is to detect whether a test dataset contains abnormal patterns by using data distribution as the metric. The sequence obeying unexpected distribution will be identified as collective anomaly, which may be generated by fault patterns. The approach consists of three steps. First, the mixture of multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to fit the structure of sample dataset and test dataset. Then, based on maximum likelihood estimate algorithm, we hope to search the optimal parameters which can fit the data distribution with the highest degree. Finally, the fixed point iteration algorithm is used to solve likelihood estimate functions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to find fault patterns of gearbox without the prior knowledge of their generated mechanisms.","2021","2024-03-06 13:06:08","2025-06-06 16:52:37","2024-03-06 13:06:08","01052","","","252","","E3S Web Conf.","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Shallow learning for bearing faults using Gaussian Mixture Models and maximum likelihood</span></span></p> </div>","/Users/Adri/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-adria.molero@upc.edu/Mi unidad/Zotero/storage/4HDDBTN4/Hu and Huang - 2021 - A Novel Vehicle Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Approach B.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Hu-y-Huang-2021-e57e846d1469438dbf338e51f4edeb52","1D input; Anomaly detection; Anomaly Score: Static; Arch type: SL; Classified; Computer Science - Machine Learning; Gearbox; GMM; Interpretability: Not addressed; Multivariate; notion; Read; Representation; RPlan: A; Single entity","","Rashed, G.I.; Kheshti, M.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a certain amount of labelled data is essential to most of the ML methods, which is not always available. In this study, an unsupervised fault diagnosis method based on iterative multi-manifold spectral clustering (IMMSC) is proposed. The IMMSC, that the affinity matrix is constructed based on local tangent space, can improve the performance of spectral clustering on multi-manifold distributed data. The IMMSC is conducted after feature extraction to divide data into different clusters first. Then local outlier factor is utilised to identify the normal condition. A fault index is found to recognise the fault conditions. The proposed IMMSC is tested on five simulation datasets and the proposed method is validated on the motor bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University. The mean accuracy of IMMSC on simulation data is 97.85%, which outperforms the other spectral clustering and traditional methods. Furthermore, the result of the IMMSC is stable over 30 individual tests. The mean accuracy of the proposed method on motor bearing dataset is 98.53%.

Therefore, in order to facilitate the practical application of a deep learning model in bearing fault diagnosis, a vibration–speed fusion network is proposed, which utilizes a transformer with a self-attention module to extract vibration features and utilizes a sparse autoencoder (SAE) network to extract sparse features from speed pulse signal. The vibration–speed fusion network enables the efﬁcient fusion of different signals in a high-dimensional vector space with a high degree of model interpretability, without additional signal processing steps. After tuning the hyperparameters of the network, the key segments of the bearing’s time-domain vibration signals can be optimally extracted, the network performance is much better than traditional deep learning methods, and the classiﬁcation accuracy can reach 95.18% and 99.85% on the two public bearing datasets from the Xi’an Jiaotong University and the University of Ottawa.","2022-10-18","2024-03-20 16:16:03","2025-06-06 17:02:57","2024-03-20 16:16:03","948","","10","10","","Machines","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.3px Arial; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial'; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 13.33px; font-kerning: none;"">Fuses an autoencoder with a transformer for bearing fault classification from speed and vibration data.

The health feature space generated by a semi-supervised autoencoder (SSAE) not only identiﬁes normal and thermal/electrical fault types, but also presents the underlying characteristics of DGA. In the proposed approach, by adding an auxiliary task that detects normal and fault states in the loss function of SSAE, the health feature space additionally enables visualization of health degradation properties. The overall procedure of the new approach includes three key steps: 1) preprocessing DGA data, 2) extracting two health features via SAAT, and 3) visualizing the two health features in two-dimensional space. In this paper, we test the proposed approach using massive unlabeled/labeled Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) databases and IEC TC 10 databases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four comparative studies are conducted with these datasets; the studies examined: 1) the effectiveness of an auxiliary detection task, 2) the effectiveness of the visualization method, 3) conventional fault diagnosis methods, and 4) the state-of-the-art, semi-supervised deep learning algorithms. By examining several evaluation metrics, these comparative studies conﬁrm that the proposed approach outperforms SSAE without the auxiliary task, existing methods, and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, in terms of deﬁning health degradation performance.

To address this problem, a self-supervised learning (SSL) method with self-attention mechanism is proposed for machinery fault diagnosis under limited labeled data and nonstationary working condition. A simple but effective pretext task is first constructed to take full advantage of unlabeled data under varying working condition. By completing the pretext task, a pretrained model is generated for effective feature representation with the constraint of signal masking and reconstruction, thus enhancing the capability of extracting discriminative features. Then, a fine-tuned model, which inherits the capability of feature extraction of pretrained one by knowledge transfer, is built by feeding into few labeled samples. Moreover, with our SSL method, transformer architecture with self-attention mechanism is used as the backbone to enhance the ability of modeling global dependency and extracting temporal information. The experimental results reveal that our method can achieve better diagnostic performance under new working condition by comparing with six advanced methods.

These sensors record the internal state of a machine, the external environment, and the interaction of machines with other machines and humans.

Since each device generates a different type of streaming data, it is normally the case that a speciﬁc kind of anomaly detection technique performs better than the others depending on the data type. For some types of data and use-cases, statistical anomaly detection techniques work better, whereas for others, deep learning-based techniques are preferred.

Sensor nodes are susceptible to fault generation due to hardware and software failures in harsh environments. Anomaly detection for the time-series streaming data of sensor nodes is a challenging but critical fault diagnosis task, particularly in large-scale WSNs. The data-driven approach is becoming essential for the goal of improving the reliability and stability of WSNs. We propose a data-driven anomaly detection approach in this paper, named median filter (MF)-stacked long short-term memory-exponentially weighted moving average (LSTM-EWMA), for time-series status data, including the operating voltage and panel temperature recorded by a sensor node deployed in the field. These status data can be used to diagnose device anomalies. First, a median filter (MF) is introduced as a preprocessor to preprocess obvious anomalies in input data. Then, stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed for prediction. Finally, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart is employed as a detector for recognizing anomalies. We evaluate the proposed approach for the panel temperature and operating voltage of time-series streaming data recorded by wireless node devices deployed in harsh field conditions for environmental monitoring. Extensive experiments were conducted on real time-series status data. The results demonstrate that compared to other approaches, the MF-stacked LSTM-EWMA approach can significantly improve the detection rate (DR) and false rate (FR). The average DR and FR values with the proposed approach are 95.46% and 4.42%, respectively. MF-stacked LSTM-EWMA anomaly detection also achieves a better F2 score than that achieved by other methods. The proposed approach provides valuable insights for anomaly detection in WSNs by detecting anomalies in the time-series status data recorded by wireless sensor nodes.","2020","2024-04-25 15:39:16","2025-06-06 17:05:56","","5646","","19","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.3390/s20195646 MAG ID: 3090041645 PMCID: 7582627 PMID: 33023175 S2ID: 857113cc4e991a1dae483cc34bc0a1886d258557","<p>Anomaly detection on wireless sensors sthat stream time series data.

Reconstruction-based models have shown promising potential in recent years for detecting anomalies in time series data. However, due to the rapid increase in data scale and dimensionality, the issues of noise and Weak Identity Mapping (WIM) during time series reconstruction have become increasingly pronounced. To address this, we introduce a novel Adaptive Dynamic Neighbor Mask (ADNM) mechanism and integrate it with the Transformer and Denoising Diffusion Model, creating a new framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection, named Denoising Diffusion Mask Transformer (DDMT). The ADNM module is introduced to mitigate information leakage between input and output features during data reconstruction, thereby alleviating the problem of WIM during reconstruction. The Denoising Diffusion Transformer (DDT) employs the Transformer as an internal neural network structure for Denoising Diffusion Model. It learns the stepwise generation process of time series data to model the probability distribution of the data, capturing normal data patterns and progressively restoring time series data by removing noise, resulting in a clear recovery of anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that combines Denoising Diffusion Model and the Transformer for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Experimental evaluations were conducted on five publicly available multivariate time series anomaly detection datasets. The results demonstrate that the model effectively identifies anomalies in time series data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.","2023-10-30","2024-12-20 11:22:53","2025-06-06 17:06:49","2024-12-20 11:22:53","","","","","","","DDMT","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2310.08800 [cs]","Comment: 16 pages, 9 figures; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Good paper on state of the art model using transformers for multivariate time series anomaly detection.

The rarity of anomalies could be a challenge for their detection as detection models are required to depend on the relations of the datapoints with their adjacent datapoints. In this work, we use the rarity of anomalies to detect them. For this, we introduce the reversible instance normalized anomaly transformer (RINAT). Rooted in the foundational principles of the anomaly transformer, RINAT incorporates both prior and series associations for each time point. The prior association uses a learnable Gaussian kernel to ensure a thorough understanding of the adjacent concentration inductive bias. In contrast, the series association method uses self-attention techniques to speciﬁcally focus on the original raw data. Furthermore, because anomalies are rare in nature, we utilize normalized data to identify series associations and employ non-normalized data to uncover prior associations. This approach enhances the modelled series associations and, consequently, improves the association discrepancies.","2023-11-19","2024-12-16 11:52:26","2025-06-06 12:31:29","2024-12-16 11:52:26","9272","","22","23","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Evolution on the Anomaly Transformer paper by adding a normalization and de-normalization technique.

However, in terms of anomaly scores, the window granularity of the frequency domain is inherently distinct from the data-point granularity of the time domain. Owing to this discrepancy, the anomaly information in the frequency domain has not been utilized to its full potential for TSAD. In this paper, we propose a TSAD framework, Dual-TF , that simultaneously uses both the time and frequency domains while breaking the time-frequency granularity discrepancy. To this end, our framework employs nested-sliding windows, with the outer and inner windows responsible for the time and frequency domains, respectively, and aligns the anomaly scores of the two domains.

Previous methods tackle the problem mainly through learning pointwise representation or pairwise association, however, neither is sufﬁcient to reason about the intricate dynamics. Recently, Transformers have shown great power in uniﬁed modeling of pointwise representation and pairwise association, and we ﬁnd that the self-attention weight distribution of each time point can embody rich association with the whole series. Our key observation is that due to the rarity of anomalies, it is extremely difﬁcult to build nontrivial associations from abnormal points to the whole series, thereby, the anomalies’ associations shall mainly concentrate on their adjacent time points. This adjacent-concentration bias implies an association-based criterion inherently distinguishable between normal and abnormal points, which we highlight through the Association Discrepancy. Technically, we propose the Anomaly Transformer with a new Anomaly-Attention mechanism to compute the association discrepancy. A minimax strategy is devised to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy.

However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attentionbased sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17%, reducing training times by up to 99% compared to the baselines.","2022-05-14","2024-12-05 12:13:50","2025-06-06 17:11:09","2024-12-05 12:13:50","","","","","","","TranAD","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2201.07284 [cs]","Comment: Accepted in VLDB 2022; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)"">Really good paper that uses transformers for anomaly detection in multivariate time series with an adversarial training (autoencoder architecture but with 2 decoders) in 2 phases.

The representation and reconstruction of time series have made extraordinary progress in existing works. However, time series is known to be complex in terms of their temporal dependency and stochasticity, which makes anomaly detection difficult. To this end, we propose a novel approach based on a decomposition auto-transformer networks(DATN) for time series anomaly detection. The time series is decomposed into seasonal and trend components, and renovated as a basic inner block deep model. With this design, transformers can decompose complex time series in a progressive manner. We also design an auto-transfomer block that determines dependencies and representation aggregation at the sub-series level based on series seasonal and trend components. Moreover, the complex transformer decoder is replaced by a simple linear decoder, which makes the model more efficient.

It employs an attention-based mechanism, akin to the deep transformer model, with key architectural modifications for predicting the next time step window in the autoencoder’s latent space.

With this focus, this paper proposes a new communication-efﬁcient ondevice federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly detection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its generalization ability. Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based Convolutional Neural NetworkLong Short Term Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention mechanism-based CNN units to capture important ﬁne-grained features, thereby preventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this model retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data. Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-k selection to improve communication efﬁciency. Extensive experiment studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately and timely detect anomalies and also reduce the communication overhead by 50% compared to the federated learning framework that does not use gradient compression scheme.","2021-04-15","2025-03-07 17:28:22","2025-06-06 17:24:24","2025-03-07 17:28:22","6348-6358","","8","8","","IEEE Internet Things J.","Deep Anomaly Detection for Time-series Data in Industrial IoT","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2007.09712 [cs]","Comment: IEEE Internet of Things Journal; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Good paper on applying anomaly detection for IIoT on multi device.

Unexpected drops in traffic can be an indication of an underlying issue and may be an early warning that remedial action may be necessary. Detecting such drops is non-trivial because streams are variable and noisy, with roughly regular spikes (in many different shapes) in traffic data. We investigated the question of whether or not we can predict anomalies in these data streams. Our goal is to utilize Machine Learning and statistical approaches to classify anomalous drops in periodic, but noisy, traffic patterns. Since we do not have a large body of labeled examples to directly apply supervised learning for anomaly classification, we approached the problem in two parts. First we used TensorFlow to train our various models including DNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs to perform regression and predict the expected value in the time series. Secondly we created anomaly detection rules that compared the actual values to predicted values. Since the problem requires finding sustained anomalies, rather than just short delays or momentary inactivity in the data, our two detection methods focused on continuous sections of activity rather than just single points. We tried multiple combinations of our models and rules and found that using the intersection of our two anomaly detection methods proved to be an effective method of detecting anomalies on almost all of our models. In the process we also found that not all data fell within our experimental assumptions, as one data stream had no periodicity, and therefore no time based model could predict it.","2017","2025-03-07 17:28:12","2025-06-06 17:50:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Good paper from Google on anomaly detection in time series using ML techniques on highly periodic data.

The problem is that the anomaly vibration signal data is scarce and difficult to be obtained, especially the problem of insufficient data in the building and deployment of multi-machine models. This paper proposes a Meta-learning method based on deep unsupervised learning(Autoencoder). We use non-labeled and a small amount of vibration signal data which is converted into 52 key physical and statistical features to build models of different motors. By inputting these 52 features into designed models, other 52 features can be reconstructed as output. We use input and output features to calculate reconstruction error which is used as the criterion for the performance of models. We also use accuracy as the criterion for the performance of models. In the actual industrial situation, the improvement of accuracy by our proposed method is about 33.50% better than the method only with unsupervised learning for the new sensor model with few vibration data.","2022-06-01","2025-05-30 15:45:12","2025-06-06 16:50:56","2025-05-30 15:45:12","1186-1189","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","Anchorage, AK, USA","en","https://doi.org/10.15223/policy-029","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Good example on using autoencoders for anomaly detection but only on a single chiller motor and dividing the data to train separately the encoder-decoder and then only the decoder (fixed).

Building such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the fact that a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed, few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Speciﬁcally, MSCRED ﬁrst constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps. Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensive empirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant dataset demonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-ofthe-art baseline methods.","2019-07-17","2025-05-30 15:44:42","2025-06-06 17:20:40","2025-05-30 15:44:42","1409-1416","","01","33","","AAAI","","","","","","","","en","https://www.aaai.org","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Paper that uses a U-net architecture with an ensemble of Attention-based Conv + LSTM from 2D input signature matrices of several channels from a power plant.

This article presents a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of unsupervised and semisupervised deep-learning-based methods for anomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and post-processing of model errors, i.e., the scoring functions independently of each other, through a grid of ten models and four scoring functions, comparing these variants to state-of-the-art methods. In time-series anomaly detection, detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual anomalous time points. Through experiments, we ﬁnd that the existing evaluation metrics either do not take events into account or cannot distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks, namely, the composite F-score (Fc1), for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model. We also ﬁnd that a simple, channel-wise model—the univariate fully connected auto-encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning candidate for both anomaly detection and diagnosis, beating state-of-the-art algorithms.","2022-06","2025-05-30 15:44:49","2025-06-06 17:21:13","2025-05-30 15:44:49","2508-2517","","6","33","","IEEE Trans.

However, these methods are susceptible to overfitting when there is insufficient data. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework, which seamlessly integrates contrastive learning and Generative Adversarial Networks. More concretely, we utilize data augmentation techniques that incorporate geometric distribution masks to expand our training data, thereby enhancing its diversity. Then, a Transformer-based Autoencoder is trained within a Generative Adversarial Network framework to capture the underlying distribution for normal points. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive loss into our discriminator to effectively regulate the GAN and ensure good generalization. Finally, anomalies are detected based on reconstruction errors. Numerous experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrated that our proposed method can effectively mitigates overfitting issues and obtains superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our model could achieve an average improvement of 9.28% in Precision, 11.33% in Recall, and 11.73% in F1-score.","2024-01","2025-06-04 16:40:25","2025-06-06 11:35:51","2025-06-04 16:40:24","103569","","1","61","","Information Processing & Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Good paper that performs UAD on multivariate time series data (on public datasets) using GAN + Transformer</p> </div>","; /Users/Adri/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-adria.molero@upc.edu/Mi unidad/Zotero/storage/92F8DELW/Miao et al. - 2024 - Reconstruction-based anomaly detection for multivariate time series using contrastive generative adv.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Miao-et-al-2024-2083c3c2f8f281008aa5fbc5b2de6020","Transformer; notion; 1D input; GAN; Multivariate; PCA; High rated; Output residuals; Anomaly Score: Static; Fleet data; Generic / Benchmark data; Reconstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
