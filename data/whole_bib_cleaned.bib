@article{achouchPredictiveMaintenanceIndustry2022,
 abstract = {In the era of the fourth industrial revolution, several concepts have arisen in parallel with this new revolution, such as predictive maintenance, which today plays a key role in sustainable manufacturing and production systems by introducing a digital version of machine maintenance. The data extracted from production processes have increased exponentially due to the proliferation of sensing technologies. Even if Maintenance 4.0 faces organizational, financial, or even data source and machine repair challenges, it remains a strong point for the companies that use it. Indeed, it allows for minimizing machine downtime and associated costs, maximizing the life cycle of the machine, and improving the quality and cadence of production. This approach is generally characterized by a very precise workflow, starting with project understanding and data collection and ending with the decision-making phase. This paper presents an exhaustive literature review of methods and applied tools for intelligent predictive maintenance models in Industry 4.0 by identifying and categorizing the life cycle of maintenance projects and the challenges encountered, and presents the models associated with this type of maintenance: condition-based maintenance (CBM), prognostics and health management (PHM), and remaining useful life (RUL). Finally, a novel applied industrial workflow of predictive maintenance is presented including the decision support phase wherein a recommendation for a predictive maintenance platform is presented. This platform ensures the management and fluid data communication between equipment throughout their life cycle in the context of smart maintenance.},

 abstract = {The meticulous monitoring and diagnosis of faults in photovoltaic (PV) systems enhances their reliability and facilitates a smooth transition to sustainable energy. This paper introduces a novel application of deep learning for fault detection and diagnosis in PV systems, employing a three-step approach. Firstly, a robust PV model is developed and fine-tuned using a heuristic optimization approach. Secondly, a comprehensive database is constructed, incorporating PV model data alongside monitored module temperature and solar irradiance for both healthy and faulty operation conditions. Lastly, fault classification utilizes features extracted from a combination consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU). The amalgamation of parallel and sequential processing enables the neural network to leverage the strengths of both convolutional and recurrent layers concurrently, facilitating effective fault detection and diagnosis. The results affirm the proposed technique's efficacy in detecting and classifying various PV fault types, such as open circuits, short circuits, and partial shading. Furthermore, this work underscores the significance of dividing fault detection and diagnosis into two distinct steps rather than employing deep learning neural networks to determine fault types directly.},

@article{anDeepLearningBasedComposite2023,
 abstract = {As the core component of many large machinery, rotating equipment occupies a high proportion in industrial manufacturing. Intelligent fault diagnosis for them is becoming the core focus of Industry 4.0 and its evolution. To address the problem of poor fault classification accuracy of rotating equipment, this paper proposes a new solution to deploy a composite fault diagnosis model at the front end to achieve low power consumption, continuous automatic identification and monitoring of equipment faults. We creatively combined the idea of speech recognition to solve the problem that traditional feature extraction methods are insufficient in handling composite fault diagnosis when dealing with fault waveform files, and used Fbank speech feature extraction idea to extract fault features, thus simplifying the complex fault diagnosis problem into an image classification problem. The generated composite fault Fbank feature data set is significantly different in visual observation. Therefore, we further designed the LeNet-F network based on the LeNet network for composite fault diagnosis. The model was validated on the K210 development board to achieve an accuracy of 97.41\% for hybrid fault classification at a model size of 2.4MB. This makes it possible to apply the deep learning method to the front end to directly complete the composite fault diagnosis.},

In this regard, the automatic detection of unknown events in machinery represents a greater challenge, since uncharacterized catastrophic faults can occur. However, the existing methods for anomaly detection present limitations when dealing with highly complex industrial systems. For that purpose, a novel fault diagnosis methodology is developed to face the anomaly detection. An unsupervised anomaly detection framework named deep-autoencoder-compact-clustering one-class support-vector machine (DAECC-OC-SVM) is presented, which aims to incorporate the advantages of automatically learnt representation by deep neural network to improved anomaly detection performance. The method combines the training of a deep-autoencoder with clustering compact model and a one-class supportvector-machine function-based outlier detection method. The addressed methodology is applied on a public rolling bearing faults experimental test bench and on multi-fault experimental test bench. The results show that the proposed methodology it is able to accurately to detect unknown defects, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.},

In the current Industry 4.0 framework, maintenance strategies based on traditional data-driven fault diagnosis schemes require enhanced capabilities to be applied over modern production systems. In fact, the integration of multiple mechanical components, the consideration of multiple operating conditions, and the appearance of combined fault patterns due to eventual multi-fault scenarios lead to complex electromechanical systems requiring advanced monitoring strategies. In this regard, data fusion schemes supported with advanced deep learning technology represent a promising approach towards a big data paradigm using cloud-based software services. However, the deep learning models' structure and hyper-parameters selection represent the main limitation when applied. Thus, in this paper, a novel deep-learning-based methodology for fault diagnosis in electromechanical systems is presented. The main benefits of the proposed methodology are the easiness of application and high adaptability to available data.

This is due to the great relevance of these systems in the industrial sector, especially for production and manufacturing processes. To guarantee the high efficiency, safety and correct performance of the different components that can form a rotating system, such as motors, bearings, gearboxes and shafts, it is essential to have monitoring systems, schemes and methodologies with the ability to diagnose and detect malfunctions on them. However, monitoring schemes present great challenges in dealing with the complexity these of systems, that implies a working environment subject to different operation condition, configurations with multiple components and the presence of faults of different nature, i.e., mechanical, electrical, electromagnetic, under isolated or combined scenarios. Recently, artificial intelligent-based techniques have been widely used in monitoring schemes, especially artificial neural networks. Due to its great capacity for characterization and feature extraction, an effort has been made to study methodologies based on these techniques. In addition, multi-layered architectures, known as deep neural networks, represent a considerable advance in the field of pattern recognition. However, the implementation of these schemes in industrial environments still presents a continuous challenge due to the requirements, such as high reliability, robustness and scalability that must be accomplish, especially in the new Industry 4.0 paradigm.},

@article{baidyaAnomalyDetectionTime2023,
 abstract = {Anomalies are infrequent in nature, but detecting these anomalies could be crucial for the proper functioning of any system. The rarity of anomalies could be a challenge for their detection as detection models are required to depend on the relations of the datapoints with their adjacent datapoints. In this work, we use the rarity of anomalies to detect them. For this, we introduce the reversible instance normalized anomaly transformer (RINAT). Rooted in the foundational principles of the anomaly transformer, RINAT incorporates both prior and series associations for each time point. The prior association uses a learnable Gaussian kernel to ensure a thorough understanding of the adjacent concentration inductive bias. In contrast, the series association method uses self-attention techniques to specifically focus on the original raw data. Furthermore, because anomalies are rare in nature, we utilize normalized data to identify series associations and employ non-normalized data to uncover prior associations. This approach enhances the modelled series associations and, consequently, improves the association discrepancies.},

 abstract = {The recent wave of digitalization is characterized by the widespread deployment of sensors in many different environments, e.g., multi-sensor systems represent a critical enabling technology towards full autonomy in industrial scenarios. Sensors usually produce vast amounts of unlabeled data in the form of multivariate time series that may capture normal conditions or anomalies. Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), i.e., the ability to identify normal or irregular operative conditions of a system through the analysis of data from multiple sensors, is crucial in many fields. However, MTSAD is challenging due to the need for simultaneous analysis of temporal (intrasensor) patterns and spatial (inter-sensor) dependencies. Unfortunately, labeling massive amounts of data is practically impossible in many real-world situations of interest (e.g., the reference ground truth may not be available or the amount of data may exceed labeling capabilities); therefore, robust unsupervised MTSAD is desirable. Recently, advanced techniques in machine learning and signal processing, including deep learning methods, have been developed for unsupervised MTSAD. In this article, we provide an extensive review of the current state of the art with a theoretical background about multivariate time-series anomaly detection. A detailed numerical evaluation of 13 promising algorithms on two publicly available multivariate time-series datasets is presented, with advantages and shortcomings highlighted.},

The precision of image processing-based vision-based technology has greatly improved for defect identification, inspection, and classification. Deep Transfer Learning (DTL), a kind of machine learning, combines the superiority of Transfer Learning (TL) for knowledge transfer with the benefits of Deep Learning (DL) for feature representation. As a result, the discipline of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis has extensively developed and researched DTL approaches. They can improve the robustness, reliability, and usefulness of DL-based fault diagnosis techniques (IFD). IFD has been the subject of several thorough and excellent studies, although most of them have appraised important research from an algorithmic standpoint, neglecting real-world applications. DTL-based IFD strategies have also not yet undergone a full evaluation. It is necessary and imperative to go through the relevant DTL-based IFD publications in light of this.

 abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods shed light on the predictions of machine learning algorithms. Several different approaches exist and have already been applied in climate science. However, usually missing ground truth explanations complicate their evaluation and comparison, subsequently impeding the choice of the XAI method. Therefore, in this work, we introduce XAI evaluation in the climate context and discuss different desired explanation properties, namely, robustness, faithfulness, randomization, complexity, and localization. To this end, we chose previous work as a case study where the decade of annual-mean temperature maps is predicted. After training both a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a convolutional neural network (CNN), multiple XAI methods are applied and their skill scores in reference to a random uniform explanation are calculated for each property. Independent of the network, we find that XAI methods such as Integrated Gradients, layerwise relevance propagation, and input times gradients exhibit considerable robustness, faithfulness, and complexity while sacrificing randomization performance. Sensitivity methods, gradient, SmoothGrad, NoiseGrad, and FusionGrad, match the robustness skill but sacrifice faithfulness and complexity for the randomization skill. We find architecture-dependent performance differences regarding robustness, complexity, and localization skills of different XAI methods, highlighting the necessity for research task-specific evaluation. Overall, our work offers an overview of different evaluation properties in the climate science context and shows how to compare and benchmark different explanation methods, assessing their suitability based on strengths and weaknesses, for the specific research problem at hand. By that, we aim to support climate researchers in the selection of a suitable XAI method.},

Meanwhile, traditional machine learning methods like gradient-boosting algorithms remain the preferred choice for most tabular data applications, while neural network alternatives require extensive hyperparameter tuning or work only in toy datasets under limited settings.

HyperFast generates a task-specific neural network tailored to an unseen dataset that can be directly used for classification inference, removing the need for training a model. We report extensive experiments with OpenML and genomic data, comparing HyperFast to competing tabular data neural networks, traditional ML methods, AutoML systems, and boosting machines. HyperFast shows highly competitive results, while being significantly faster. Additionally, our approach demonstrates robust adaptability across a variety of classification tasks with little to no fine-tuning, positioning HyperFast as a strong solution for numerous applications and rapid model deployment.

The data collected from machinery and the extraction of valuable information through machine learning (ML) have assumed a crucial role. As a result, data-driven predictive maintenance (PdM) has received significant attention from academics and industries. However, practical issues are limiting the implementation of PdM in manufacturing plants. These issues are related to the availability, quantity, and completeness of the collected data, which do not contain all machinery health conditions, are often unprovided with the contextual information needed by ML models, and are huge in terms of gigabytes per minute. As an extension of previous work by the authors, this paper aims to validate the methodology for streaming fault and novelty detection that reduces the quantity of data to transfer and store, allows the automatic collection of contextual information, and recognizes novel system behaviors.

Among the condition based maintenance strategies, data-driven fault diagnosis methodologies have gained attention because of the high performance and widen range of applicability, mainly, due to less restrictive constrains in comparison to other approaches. Currently, an increased effort is been made to study reliable methodologies that could diagnose multiple faults on a machine with initial applications in controlled environments at laboratory scale.},

@article{cenReviewDataDrivenMachinery2022,
 abstract = {Purpose{\enspace} This article aims to systematically review the recent research advances in data-driven machinery fault diagnosis based on machine learning algorithms, and provide valuable guidance for future research directions in this field. Methods{\enspace} This article reviews the research results of data-driven fault diagnosis methods of recent years, and it includes the application status and research progress of machinery fault diagnosis in three frameworks: shallow machine learning (SML), deep learning (DL), and transfer learning (TL). Many publications on this topic are classified and summarized. The related theories, application research, advantages, and disadvantages of several main algorithms under each framework are discussed. Results{\enspace} It has shown that SML-based diagnosis models are simple, reliable, and fast to train. For relatively uncomplicated systems, SML-based diagnosis models still have important applications. For diagnosis tasks with large amounts of training samples and the pursuit of higher accuracy, DL-based diagnosis models can provide end-to-end diagnostic services for complex systems as well as compound faults. TL-based diagnosis models can realize knowledge transfer across conditions, machines, and even fields to solve the problems of data scarcity and sample imbalance that often occur in fault diagnosis. However, in the face of increasingly complex engineering systems, the applications of machine learning algorithms in machinery fault diagnosis are still challenging. Conclusions{\enspace} In future research, the fusion of different machine learning frameworks could solve the problems of inadequate feature extraction and slow training of diagnostic models. Transformer neural network based on pure attention mechanism breaks through the shortcomings of LSTM neural network which cannot be computed in parallel, and it is a worthy research direction in the field of fault diagnosis. In addition, machinery fault diagnosis method based on machine learning algorithms also has great potential for improvement in transferability, federated transfer learning, and strong noise background. These proposed future research directions can provide new ideas for researchers to promote the development of machine learning algorithms in machinery fault diagnosis.},

 abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been researched within diverse research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

@article{cheMultiscaleTimeFrequencySparse2023,
 abstract = {Transformer model is being gradually studied and applied in bearing fault diagnosis tasks, which can overcome the feature extraction defects caused by long-term dependencies in convolution neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN). To optimize the structure of existing transformer-like methods and improve the diagnostic accuracy, we proposed a novel method based on the multiscale time-frequency sparse transformer (MTFST) in this paper. First, a novel tokenizer based on shot-time Fourier transform (STFT) is designed, which processes the 1D format raw signals into 2D format discrete time-frequency sequences in the embedding space. Second, a sparse self-attention mechanism is designed to eliminate the feature mapping defect in naive self-attention mechanism. Then, the novel encoder-decoder structure is presented, the multiple encoders are employed to extract the hidden feature of different time-frequency sequences obtained by STFT with different window widths, and the decoder is used to remap the deep information and connect to the classifier for discriminating fault types. The proposed method is tested in the XJTU-SY bearing dataset and self-made experiment rig dataset, and the following work is conducted. The influences of hyperparameters on diagnosis accuracy and number of parameters are analysed in detail. The weights of the attention mechanism (AM) are visualized and analysed to study the interpretability, which explains the partly working pattern of the network. In the comparison test with other existing CNN, RNN, and transformer models, the diagnosis accuracy of different methods is statistically analysed, feature vectors are presented via the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method, and the proposed MTFST obtains the best accuracy and feature distribution form. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in bearing fault diagnosis.},

 abstract = {The safe operation of Industrial robots is a major concern in intelligent manufacturing. Accurate compound fault diagnosis is essential to the safe operation of industrial robots, while it is challenging to achieve since the compound fault samples are hard to be collected. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a useful tool for addressing the data imbalance issue. However, the computation efficiency of GAN in addressing the data imbalance issue has not been investigated. Hence, this study proposes a lightweight GAN named compact con\- volutional Transformers-GAN (CCT-GAN) to alleviate the data imbalance issue in compound fault diagnosis modelling. Firstly, the feedback current signals collected from the industrial robot are transformed into timefrequency images via continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Secondly, CCT-GAN is designed to achieve high-quality fake data generation and compound fault diagnosis modelling without large computational costs. Thirdly, the relation between a single fault and the compound fault is considered in the compound fault diagnosis modelling via multi-hot representation to alleviate the data imbalance issue. An experimental study based on the real-world compound fault dataset of industrial robots reveals that the proposed CCT-GAN shows merits in compound fault diagnosis modelling in comparison with the prevailing algorithms. The results indicate that CCTGAN can performance of compound fault diagnosis when only 100 data samples from each compound fault category are available.},

@article{chengIntelligentFaultDiagnosis2023,
 abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at industrial fault diagnosis. Their performance heavily relies on the quality of human-annotated labels. Due to perception limitations of annotators, industrial time series samples (such as vibration and voltage signals) are frequently mislabeled in several conditions, such as samples with frequency domain feature differences and samples on class borders. Hence, an annotated industrial dataset will inevitably contain noisy labels at a certain level, leading to overfitting and poor generalization of DNNs. In this work, we introduce an industrial noisy label semisupervised learning (INL-SSL) fault diagnosis approach, addressing the problem that a certain number of samples in an industrial dataset are mislabeled. The proposed INL-SSL architecture simultaneously trains two DNNs, which cross-train on each other to filter noisy label errors. In particular, a fitted Gaussian mixture model divides time series samples of each DNN flow into an unlabeled set with samples likely to be noisy and a labeled set with samples likely to be clean. Given the labeled and unlabeled data, we proposed a time series MixMatch semisupervised learning strategy to train the diagnostic model. Ablation study verifies the benefit of the proposed time series augmentation techniques for semisupervised training. Extensive experiments on a benchmark industrial dataset of rolling element bearings (REB) reveal that the INL-SSL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. On another self-collected REB dataset, the proposed approach also exceeds other comparison methods under noise ratios from 20\% to 90\%, validating the model's generalizability.},

 abstract = {Many real-world IoT systems, which include a variety of internet-connected sensory devices, produce substantial amounts of multivariate time series data. Meanwhile, vital IoT infrastructures like smart power grids and water distribution networks are frequently targeted by cyber-attacks, making anomaly detection an important study topic. Modeling such relatedness is, nevertheless, unavoidable for any efficient and effective anomaly detection system, given the intricate topological and nonlinear connections that are originally unknown among sensors. Furthermore, detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is difficult due to their temporal dependency and stochasticity. This paper presented GTA, a new framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection that involves automatically learning a graph structure, graph convolution, and modeling temporal dependency using a Transformer-based architecture. The connection learning policy, which is based on the Gumbel-softmax sampling approach to learn bi-directed links among sensors directly, is at the heart of learning graph structure. To describe the anomaly information flow between network nodes, we introduced a new graph convolution called Influence Propagation convolution. In addition, to tackle the quadratic complexity barrier, we suggested a multibranch attention mechanism to replace the original multi-head self-attention method. Extensive experiments on four publicly available anomaly detection benchmarks further demonstrate the superiority of our approach over alternative state-of-the-arts.

 abstract = {Nowadays, most deep-learning-based bearing fault diagnosis methods are studied under the condition of steady speed, while the performance of these models cannot be fully played under time-varying conditions. Therefore, in order to facilitate the practical application of a deep learning model in bearing fault diagnosis, a vibration--speed fusion network is proposed, which utilizes a transformer with a self-attention module to extract vibration features and utilizes a sparse autoencoder (SAE) network to extract sparse features from speed pulse signal. The vibration--speed fusion network enables the efficient fusion of different signals in a high-dimensional vector space with a high degree of model interpretability, without additional signal processing steps. After tuning the hyperparameters of the network, the key segments of the bearing's time-domain vibration signals can be optimally extracted, the network performance is much better than traditional deep learning methods, and the classification accuracy can reach 95.18\% and 99.85\% on the two public bearing datasets from the Xi'an Jiaotong University and the University of Ottawa.},

The original incarnation of the archive had sixteen data sets but since that time, it has gone through periodic expansions. The last expansion took place in the summer of 2015 when the archive grew from 45 to 85 data sets. This paper introduces and will focus on the new data expansion from 85 to 128 data sets. Beyond expanding this valuable resource, this paper offers pragmatic advice to anyone who may wish to evaluate a new algorithm on the archive.

Moreover, they may have been able to achieve the same improvement with a much simpler modification, requiring just a single line of code.},

@article{dengFaultDiagnosisMethod2023,
 abstract = {The realization of accurate fault diagnosis is crucial to ensure the normal operation of machines. At present, an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on deep learning has been widely applied in mechanical areas due to its strong ability of feature extraction and accurate identification. However, it often depends on enough training samples. Generally, the model performance depends on sufficient training samples. However, the fault data are always insufficient in practical engineering as the mechanical equipment often works under normal conditions, resulting in imbalanced data. Deep learning-based models trained directly with the imbalanced data will greatly reduce the diagnosis accuracy. In this paper, a diagnosis method is proposed to address the imbalanced data problem and enhance the diagnosis accuracy. Firstly, signals from multiple sensors are processed by the wavelet transform to enhance data features, which are then squeezed and fused through pooling and splicing operations. Subsequently, improved adversarial networks are constructed to generate new samples for data augmentation. Finally, an improved residual network is constructed by introducing the convolutional block attention module for enhancing the diagnosis performance. The experiments containing two different types of bearing datasets are adopted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in single-class and multi-class data imbalance cases. The results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality synthetic samples and improve the diagnosis accuracy presenting great potential in imbalanced fault diagnosis.},

However, lacking of fault samples, the training stage and testing stage being mutually independent, and not recognizing new fault type restrict their application in some cases. This paper presents a method of anomaly detection and fault diagnosis with online adaptive learning under small training samples. This approach has classification function and clustering function at the same time. The samples of known fault type are categorized and the samples of unknown fault type are clustered with this approach. To determine the performance and possible advantages of the approaches, the experiments on ball bearing fault data and Iris data were performed. Results show that our proposed approach outperforms the other methods, when the training samples are inadequate to cover all of the fault types. The less the known fault types are, the more advantages it has. To a certain extent, this approach could make up for the disadvantages of other methods of anomaly detection and fault diagnosis.},

 abstract = {Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66\% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.},

@article{farahaniTimeseriesClassificationSmart2025,
 abstract = {Manufacturing is transformed towards smart manufacturing, entering a new data-driven era fueled by digital technologies. The resulting Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) gather extensive amounts of diverse data, thanks to the growing number of sensors and rapid advances in sensing technologies. Among the various data types available in SMS settings, time-series data plays a pivotal role. Hence, Time-Series Classification (TSC) emerges as a crucial task in this domain. Over the past decade, researchers have introduced numerous methods for TSC, necessitating not only algorithmic development and analysis but also validation and empirical comparison. This dual approach holds substantial value for practitioners by streamlining choices and revealing insights into models' strengths and weaknesses. The objective of this study is to fill this gap by providing a rigorous experimental evaluation of the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for TSC tasks in manufacturing and industrial settings. We first explored and compiled a comprehensive list of more than 92 state-of-the-art algorithms from both TSC and manufacturing literature. Following this, we methodologically selected the 36 most representative algorithms from this list. To evaluate their performance across various manufacturing classification tasks, we curated a set of 22 manufacturing datasets, representative of different characteristics that cover diverse manufacturing problems. Subsequently, we implemented and evaluated the algorithms on the manufacturing benchmark datasets, and analyzed the results for each dataset. Based on the results, ResNet, DrCIF, InceptionTime, and ARSENAL emerged as the top-performing algorithms, boasting an average accuracy of over 96.6 \% across all 22 manufacturing TSC datasets. These findings underscore the robustness, efficiency, scalability, and effectiveness of convolutional kernels in capturing temporal features in time-series data collected from manufacturing systems for TSC tasks, as three out of the top four performing algorithms leverage these kernels for feature extraction. Additionally, LSTM, BiLSTM, and TS-LSTM algorithms deserve recognition for their effectiveness in capturing features within manufacturing time-series data using RNN-based structures.},

Recently, various methods have been proposed to detect behavioural anomalies, however existing approaches focus on multivariate time series and ignore communication between entities. Moreover, we aim to support end-users in not only in locating entities and sensors causing an anomaly at a certain period, but also explain this decision. We propose a scalable approach to detect anomalies using a two-step approach. First, we recover relations between entities in the network, since relations are often dynamic in nature and caused by an unknown underlying process. Next, we report anomalies based on an embedding of sequential patterns. Pattern mining is efficient and supports interpretation, i.e. patterns represent frequent occurring behaviour in time series. We extend pattern mining to filter sequential patterns based on frequency, temporal constraints and minimum description length. We collect and release two public datasets for international broadcasting and X from an Internet company. BAD achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.78 on 9 benchmark datasets, significantly outperforming the best baseline by 3\%.

@article{gargEvaluationAnomalyDetection2022,
 abstract = {Several techniques for multivariate time series anomaly detection have been proposed recently, but a systematic comparison on a common set of datasets and metrics is lacking. This article presents a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of unsupervised and semisupervised deep-learning-based methods for anomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and post-processing of model errors, i.e., the scoring functions independently of each other, through a grid of ten models and four scoring functions, comparing these variants to state-of-the-art methods. In time-series anomaly detection, detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual anomalous time points. Through experiments, we find that the existing evaluation metrics either do not take events into account or cannot distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks, namely, the composite F-score (Fc1), for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model. We also find that a simple, channel-wise model---the univariate fully connected auto-encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning candidate for both anomaly detection and diagnosis, beating state-of-the-art algorithms.},

 abstract = {Anomaly detection in time-series has a wide range of practical applications. While numerous anomaly detection methods have been proposed in the literature, a recent survey concluded that no single method is the most accurate across various datasets. To make matters worse, anomaly labels are scarce and rarely available in practice. The practical problem of selecting the most accurate model for a given dataset without labels has received little attention in the literature. This paper answers this question i.e. Given an unlabeled dataset and a set of candidate anomaly detectors, how can we select the most accurate model? To this end, we identify three classes of surrogate (unsupervised) metrics, namely, prediction error, model centrality, and performance on injected synthetic anomalies, and show that some metrics are highly correlated with standard supervised anomaly detection performance metrics such as the F1 score, but to varying degrees. We formulate metric combination with multiple imperfect surrogate metrics as a robust rank aggregation problem. We then provide theoretical justification behind the proposed approach. Large-scale experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed unsupervised approach is as effective as selecting the most accurate model based on partially labeled data.},

Regarding the time-frequency energy matrix as the pixel matrix of digital image, a method for image similarity recognition based on convolution neural network (CNN) is used for fault classification.

Two simulation models are established in the PSCAD/EMTDC and physical system environment, respectively. The performance of the presented method is studied in the MATLAB environment.

 abstract = {The efforts to decrease air pollutants using renewable energies, especially photovoltaic energy, are developing rapidly worldwide. Photovoltaic powerhouses contain a large number of photovoltaic power generators called photovoltaic modules that must be investigated regularly. However, these modules cannot be investigated with traditional methods because they are time-consuming and life-threatening. In this article, a deep learning algorithm-based method was developed for photovoltaic powerhouse investigation. Two types of defects were studied in photovoltaic powerhouses, namely hotspot, and hot substring. These defects are more frequent in the photovoltaic powerhouse. Datasets used in this work contain thermal images of photovoltaic modules obtained from aerial and terrestrial images. The prepared network was evaluated by some statistical parameters, including F1 score, accuracy, and precision. Finally, the network was classified with a total accuracy of 0.98, and the obtained results were compared with those of other works.},

To solve the problem, this paper combines convolutional neural network's excellent feature processing ability with the excellent generalization ability of Support Vector Machine (SVM). The proposed CNN-SVM system is applied in bearing fault diagnosis, which takes the time domain diagram of bearing vibration data as the system input. The features are extracted by CNN, and realizes the final bearing state recognition by SVM. The contribution of the paper is to add three conditions for automatically switch CNN to SVM. The results show that the system has the advantages of less time-consuming, high precision and strong generalization ability.

@article{huangMetricLearningBasedFault2024,
 abstract = {Industrial system monitoring includes fault diagnosis and anomaly detection, which have received extensive attention, since they can recognize the fault types and detect unknown anomalies. However, a separate fault diagnosis method or anomaly detection method cannot identify unknown faults and distinguish between different fault types simultaneously; thus, it is difficult to meet the increasing demand for safety and reliability of industrial systems. Besides, the actual system often operates in varying working conditions and is disturbed by the noise, which results in the intraclass variance of the raw data and degrades the performance of industrial system monitoring. To solve these problems, a metric learning-based fault diagnosis and anomaly detection method is proposed. Fault diagnosis and anomaly detection are adaptively fused in the proposed endto-end model, where anomaly detection can prevent the model from misjudging the unknown anomaly as the known type, while fault diagnosis can identify the specific type of system fault. In addition, a novel multicenter loss is introduced to restrain the intraclass variance. Compared with manual feature extraction that can only extract suboptimal features, it can learn discriminant features automatically for both fault diagnosis and anomaly detection tasks. Experiments on three-phase flow (TPF) facility and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing have demonstrated that the proposed method can avoid the interference of intraclass variances and learn features that are effective for identifying tasks. Moreover, it achieves the best performance in both fault diagnosis and anomaly detection.},

Based on the limited sample data, the principle of the approach is to detect whether a test dataset contains abnormal patterns by using data distribution as the metric. The sequence obeying unexpected distribution will be identified as collective anomaly, which may be generated by fault patterns. The approach consists of three steps. First, the mixture of multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to fit the structure of sample dataset and test dataset. Then, based on maximum likelihood estimate algorithm, we hope to search the optimal parameters which can fit the data distribution with the highest degree. Finally, the fixed point iteration algorithm is used to solve likelihood estimate functions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to find fault patterns of gearbox without the prior knowledge of their generated mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Uncertainty-aware deep learning (DL) models recently gained attention in fault diagnosis as a way to promote the reliable detection of faults when out-of-distribution (OOD) data arise from unseen faults (epistemic uncertainty) or the presence of noise (aleatoric uncertainty). In this paper, we present the first comprehensive comparative study of state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware DL architectures for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery, where different scenarios affected by epistemic uncertainty and different types of aleatoric uncertainty are investigated. The selected architectures include sampling by dropout, Bayesian neural networks, and deep ensembles. Moreover, to distinguish between in-distribution and OOD data in the different scenarios two uncertainty thresholds, one of which is introduced in this paper, are alternatively applied. Our empirical findings offer guidance to practitioners and researchers who have to deploy real-world uncertainty-aware fault diagnosis systems. In particular, they reveal that, in the presence of epistemic uncertainty, all DL models are capable of effectively detecting, on average, a substantial portion of OOD data across all the scenarios. However, deep ensemble models show superior performance, independently of the uncertainty threshold used for discrimination. In the presence of aleatoric uncertainty, the noise level plays an important role. Specifically, low noise levels hinder the models' ability to effectively detect OOD data. Even in this case, however, deep ensemble models exhibit a milder degradation in performance, dominating the others. These achievements, combined with their shorter inference time, make deep ensemble architectures the preferred choice.},

@article{jiaDeepNeuralNetworks2016,
 abstract = {Aiming to promptly process the massive fault data and automatically provide accurate diagnosis results, numerous studies have been conducted on intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. Among these studies, the methods based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deficiencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a specific diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artificial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deficiencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deficiencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods.},

However, DL models remain commonly uninterpretable and are merely black boxes, hampering their wide use in bearing fault diagnosis. To classify the bearing fault effectively and understand the learned representations which are hidden inside these models, the binary arborescent filter is embedded in the Transformer in this paper. With the help of the binary arborescent filter, a novel tokenizer is constructed instead of the original one which is only used for the natural language process. We show how the feature constructed by the tokenizer can be interpreted as classifiers that determine different fault types. Therefore, based on the Binary arborescent filter Transformer, a new end-to-end fault diagnostic framework is developed to boost the diagnostic performance of the conventional DL-based bearing fault diagnosis (BFD) models.

 abstract = {In this study, we address the issue of limited generalization capabilities in intelligent diagnosis models caused by the lack of high-quality fault data samples for aero-engine rolling bearings. We provide a fault anomaly detection technique based on distillation learning to address this issue. Two Vision Transformer (ViT) models are specif\- ically used in the distillation learning process, one of which serves as the teacher network and the other as the student network. By using a small-scale student network model, the computational efficiency of the model is increased without sacrificing model accuracy. For feature-centered representation, new loss and anomaly score functions are created, and an enhanced Transformer encoder with the residual block is proposed. Then, a rolling bearing dynamics simulation method is used to obtain rich fault sample data, and the pre-training of the teacher network is completed. For anomaly detection, the training of the student network is completed based on the proposed loss function and the pre-trained teacher network, using only the vibration acceleration samples ob\- tained from the normal state. Finally, the trained completed network and the designed anomaly score function are used to achieve the anomaly detection of rolling bearing faults. The experimental validation was carried out on two sets of test data and one set of real vibration data of a whole aero-engine, and the detection accuracy reached 100 \%. The results show that the proposed method has a high capability of rolling bearing fault anomaly detection.},

@article{kimSemiSupervisedAutoencoderAuxiliary2020,
 abstract = {This paper proposes a semi-supervised autoencoder with an auxiliary task (SAAT) to extract a health feature space for power transformer fault diagnosis using dissolved gas analysis (DGA). The health feature space generated by a semi-supervised autoencoder (SSAE) not only identifies normal and thermal/electrical fault types, but also presents the underlying characteristics of DGA. In the proposed approach, by adding an auxiliary task that detects normal and fault states in the loss function of SSAE, the health feature space additionally enables visualization of health degradation properties. The overall procedure of the new approach includes three key steps: 1) preprocessing DGA data, 2) extracting two health features via SAAT, and 3) visualizing the two health features in two-dimensional space. In this paper, we test the proposed approach using massive unlabeled/labeled Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) databases and IEC TC 10 databases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four comparative studies are conducted with these datasets; the studies examined: 1) the effectiveness of an auxiliary detection task, 2) the effectiveness of the visualization method, 3) conventional fault diagnosis methods, and 4) the state-of-the-art, semi-supervised deep learning algorithms. By examining several evaluation metrics, these comparative studies confirm that the proposed approach outperforms SSAE without the auxiliary task, existing methods, and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, in terms of defining health degradation performance. We expect that the proposed SAAT-based health feature space approach will be widely applicable to intuitively monitor the health state of power transformers in the real world.},

The prior model is trained on the discrete latent space of a time--frequency domain. Notably, the dimensional semantics of the time--frequency domain are preserved in the latent space, enabling us to compute anomaly scores across different frequency bands, which provides a better insight into the detected anomalies. Additionally, the generative nature of the prior model allows for sampling likely normal states for detected anomalies, enhancing the explainability of the detected anomalies through counterfactuals.

 abstract = {The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs) demonstrates the potential for artificial general intelligence, revealing new opportunities in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing. However, a notable gap exists in applying these LLMs in industry, primarily due to their training on general knowledge rather than domain-specific knowledge. Such specialized domain knowledge is vital for effectively addressing the complex needs of industrial applications. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a unified industrial large knowledge model (ILKM) framework, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize future industries. In addition, ILKMs and LLMs are compared from eight perspectives. Finally, the ``6S Principle'' is proposed as the guideline for ILKM development, and several potential opportunities are highlighted for ILKM deployment in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing.},

@article{liCrossdomainAugmentationDiagnosis2023,
 abstract = {Intelligent fault diagnosis based on domain adaptation has recently been extensively researched to promote reliability of safety-critical assets under different working conditions. However, target data may be inaccessible in the model training phase, resulting in the degradation or failure of the diagnosis model. Therefore, this paper introduces a new idea called cross-domain augmentation (CDA) to achieve diagnosis under unseen working conditions, which are frequently occurred in industrial scenarios. To realize this idea, an adversarial domainaugmented generalization (ADAG) method is proposed with domain augmentation via convex combination of data and feature-label pairs. Through adversarial training on multi-source domains and the augmented domain, ADAG enables learning generalized and augmented features, which are proximal representation in the unseen domain, facilitating the generalization ability of the model. Moreover, feature extractor and domain classifier are optimized as adversaries in model training to obtain domain-invariant features, while the fault classifier is trained to identify the features. Extensive experiment studies indicate that ADAG can successfully solve the crossdomain diagnosis problem under unseen working conditions. For SDUST case study, ADAG promotes the model accuracy by 1.44\%; while for a more challenging Ottawa case study, it promotes the model accuracy by 5.34\%. Moreover, the domain discrepancy is reduced by 4.6\%.},

@article{liDeepLearningApproach2019,
 abstract = {Anomaly in mechanical systems may cause equipment to break down with serious safety, environment, and economic impact. Since many mechanical equipment usually operates under tough working environments, which makes them vulnerable to types of faults, anomaly detection for mechanical equipment usually requires considerable domain knowledge. However, a common dilemma in many practical applications is that one may not be able to obtain the empirical knowledge about anomaly or the history data is completely unlabelled, which makes conventional fault identification methods not applicable. In order to fill the gap, this paper proposes a novel deep learning--based method for anomaly detection in mechanical equipment by combining two types of deep learning architectures, stacked autoencoders (SAE) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, to identify anomaly condition in a completely unsupervised manner. The proposed method focuses on the anomaly detection through multiple features sequence when the history data is unlabelled and the empirical knowledge about anomaly is absent. An experiment for anomaly detection in rotary machinery through wavelet packet decomposition (WPD) and data-driven models demonstrates the efficiency and stability of the proposed approach. The method can be divided into two stages: SAE-based multiple features sequence representation and LSTM-based anomaly identification. During the experiment, fivefold crossvalidation has been applied to validate the performance and stability of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed approach could detect anomaly working condition with 99\% accuracy under a completely unsupervised learning environment and offer an alternative method to leverage and integrate features for anomaly detection without empirical knowledge.},

@misc{liFaultDiagnosisHeterogeneous2025,
 abstract = {Deep learning methods have shown promising performance in fault diagnosis for multimode process. Most existing studies assume that the collected health state categories from different operating modes are identical. However, in real industrial scenarios, these categories typically exhibit only partial overlap. The incompleteness of the available data and the large distributional differences between the operating modes pose a significant challenge to existing fault diagnosis methods. To address this problem, a novel fault diagnosis model named self-adaptive temporal-spatial attention network (TSA-SAN) is proposed. First, inter-mode mappings are constructed using healthy category data to generate multimode samples. To enrich the diversity of the fault data, interpolation is performed between healthy and fault samples. Subsequently, the fault diagnosis model is trained using real and generated data. The self-adaptive instance normalization is established to suppress irrelevant information while retaining essential statistical features for diagnosis. In addition, a temporal-spatial attention mechanism is constructed to focus on the key features, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

As a result, DTL techniques can make DL-based fault diagnosis methods more reliable, robust and applicable, and they have been widely developed and investigated in the field of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis (IFD). Although several systematic and valuable review articles have been published on the topic of IFD, they summarized relevant research only from an algorithm perspective and overlooked practical ap\- plications in industry scenarios. Furthermore, a comprehensive review on DTL-based IFD methods is still lacking. From this insight, it is particularly important and more necessary to compre\- hensively survey the relevant publications of DTL-based IFD, which will help readers to conve\- niently understand the current state-of-the-art techniques and to quickly design an effective solution for solving IFD problems in practice. First, theoretical backgrounds of DTL are briefly introduced to present how the transfer learning techniques can be integrated with deep learning models. Then, major applications of DTL and their recent developments in the field of IFD are detailed and discussed. More importantly, suggestions on how to select DTL algorithms in practical applications, and some future challenges are shared. Finally, conclusions of this survey are given.

 abstract = {Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a widely used additive manufacturing technology in various engineering applications. However, ensuring product quality is critical to the success of the FDM manufacturing process because defects can occur owing to various factors. An effective diagnosis facilitates timely corrective measures, thus enhancing quality control significantly. Although vision-based deep learning diagnostic methods have shown encouraging results, they do not take the autocorrelation of defective pixels resulting from layer-by-layer accumulation into account. The existing models do not fully utilize spatiotemporal correlations, thus resulting in limited diagnostic accuracy under certain circumstances. Hence, a time-series vision Transformer is proposed for the drifting process parameters that considers the spatiotemporal characteristics of the acquired data. In this approach, raw layer-wise images are decomposed and integrated into image streams containing temporal and spatial information. A Transformer network with cross space-time attention is adopted to extract spatiotemporal features from constructed image streams. A laboratory experiment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of our model. The overall framework not only achieves higher accuracy of 90.8 \%, but also demonstrates better generalizability for different parameter drifts compared with traditional and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Furthermore, data collected by the edge device may contain the user's private data, which is challenging the current detection approaches as user privacy is calling for the public concern in recent years. With this focus, this paper proposes a new communication-efficient ondevice federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly detection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Specifically, we first introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its generalization ability. Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based Convolutional Neural NetworkLong Short Term Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention mechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby preventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this model retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data. Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-k selection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experiment studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately and timely detect anomalies and also reduce the communication overhead by 50\% compared to the federated learning framework that does not use gradient compression scheme.},

First, a plurality of convolution layers is used to capture low-level local structure features. Then, the transformer is applied to the sequences of split patches for modeling global dependencies and extracting the domain invariant features. Meanwhile, a data augmentation strategy based on regional mixing is used to enhance the generalization. Furthermore, to obtain a more discriminative feature representation, we designed a regularization based on unsupervised contrastive learning for calibration of attention distri\- bution. The results demonstrated that transformers have an aptitude for analyzing time series data even under sharp variation, which do not need to deliberately consider extra modules for cross-domain disentanglement. The proposed method is superior to several advanced trans\- formers in three case studies under speed transient conditions with few samples.},

@article{liuKnowledgeinformedFIRbasedCrosscategory2025,
 abstract = {Relying on sufficient training data, the existing fault diagnosis methods rarely focus on the methodological interpretability and the data scarcity in real industrial scenarios simultaneously. Motivated by this issue, we deeply reexamined the intrinsic characteristics of fault signals and the guiding significance of classical signalprocessing methods for feature enhancement. From the perspective of multiscale modes, this study tailors multiple learnable knowledge-informed finite impulse response (FIR) filtering kernels to extract sensitive modes for explainable feature enhancement. On this foundation, a knowledge-informed FIR-based cross-category filtering (FIR-CCF) framework is further proposed for interpretable small-sample fault diagnosis. With the consideration of the mode complexity, a cross-category filtering strategy is explored to further enhance feature expressions for identifying single state. To be special, this strategy divides a multi-class recognition process into multiple two-class recognition task. A multi-task learning is then presented where multiple binary-class base learners (BCBLearners) that consists of a feature extractor and a two-class classifier is established to seek discriminate mode features for each type of state. Eventually, all feature extractors are fixed and a multi-class classifier is established and to fuse all mode features for high-precision multi-class identification via ensemble learning. As a variant of signal-processing-collaborated deep learning frameworks, the FIR-CCF method fully exploits the strengths of signal-processing methods in interpretability and feature extraction. Three experimental cases highlight the superiority and significant improvement of the FIR-CCF framework over other five state-ofthe-art diagnosis methods and three ablation models. Specially, extensive visualization is implemented to place in-depth insight into how the FIR-CCF framework works. It can be also foreseen that the signal-processingcollaborated deep learning framework shows enormous potential in interpretable fault diagnosis for knowledge-informed artificial intelligence.

Compared with traditional fault diagnosis techniques, such as spectrum analysis, deep learning has been widely used in the field of mechanical system fault diagnosis due to its powerful data expression ability, and has achieved certain research results. One-dimensional convolutional neural network is a widely used model for deep learning, so in this paper, the one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) in the deep learning theory and the vibration signal analysis method are integrated and applied to the fault identification of mechanical transmission system to achieve accurate diagnosis and classification of faults. The experiment is mainly to collect the vibration signal data of different fault states such as broken teeth, cracking, shaft unbalance, bearing wear, and excessive friction of the driven wheel of the mechanical transmission system, it was divided into training set and testing set according to an appropriate proportion, and 1D-CNN was built using Python. The deep learning model deeply analyzed the influence of different data sample sizes and different model parameters on the recognition accuracy, and obtained an ideal diagnostic model based on variable learning rate through parameter adjustment and comparative analysis. This experimental results show that the recognition method based on one-dimensional convolutional neural network can be effectively applied to the fault diagnosis of related mechanical transmission, and has a high diagnosis accuracy.},

@inproceedings{lorentiPredictiveMaintenanceIndustry2023,
 abstract = {Predictive Maintenance (PdM) aims to detect forthcoming failures in machinery to reduce costs associated with defective products and equipment inactivity. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation is the most common approach in PdM: in this formalization, forecast or regression models aim at predicting the time/process iterations left before machinery loses its operation ability or a failure happens. In the RUL literature, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms are typically the preferred choice because they achieve high performance and can automatically handle the feature extraction phase. Usually, developed DL architectures are application or equipment specific; thus, there is no clear way to select, design, or implement such architectures. However, the research usually does not justify the choice of one architecture over another that may potentially work for the same problem. In addition, many of the reviewed papers do not investigate the computational complexity of these techniques, which is a critical aspect of real-time applications. In this work, we compare the most widely used deep learning architectures for performing RUL estimation in four datasets: two public datasets known in the PdM research community and two confidential industrial datasets. Moreover, we release a library called CeRULEo, to support the research within this field, speeding up the development of RUL models and providing a complete pre-processing pipeline for dataset handling.},

@article{maoOnlineDetectionBearing2020,
 abstract = {Although researchers have made substantial progress in bearing fault detection and diagnosis recently, incipient fault detection, especially online detection, is still at an initial stage. Generally speaking, online detection of incipient faults is still subject to the following challenges: (1) improving discriminative ability of incipient fault features; (2) adaptive recognition of the distribution inconsistency that exists in online sequential data; (3) achieving automatic detections with avoiding manual adjustment of detection criterion; and (4) reducing false alarm rate. To address these challenges, this paper presents a new approach for bearing incipient fault online detection using semi-supervised architecture and deep feature representation. This approach is simple and effective. First, we extract deep features using stacked denoising auto-encoder from the target bearing's normal state data and an auxiliary bearing's fault state data. Second, we introduce safe semi-supervised support vector machine (S4VM), a kind of semi-supervised classifier, to identify the sequentially arrived data of the target bearing as normal or anomalous. To update the classifier effectively, we use the principal curve to generate synthetic fault data for keeping data classes balanced during online condition monitoring. Finally, we propose a new fault alarm criterion based on S4VM generalization error upper bound to adaptively recognize the occurrence of an incipient fault. The experimental results on three datasets (IEEE PHM Challenge 2012, IMS and XJTU-SY) demonstrate the effectiveness and high reliability of the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {The majority of existing anomaly detection methods for multivariate time series are based on Transformers and Autoencoders owing to their superior capabilities. However, these methods are susceptible to overfitting when there is insufficient data. To address this issue, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection framework, which seamlessly integrates contrastive learning and Generative Adversarial Networks. More concretely, we utilize data augmentation techniques that incorporate geometric distribution masks to expand our training data, thereby enhancing its diversity. Then, a Transformer-based Autoencoder is trained within a Generative Adversarial Network framework to capture the underlying distribution for normal points. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive loss into our discriminator to effectively regulate the GAN and ensure good generalization. Finally, anomalies are detected based on reconstruction errors. Numerous experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrated that our proposed method can effectively mitigates overfitting issues and obtains superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our model could achieve an average improvement of 9.28\% in Precision, 11.33\% in Recall, and 11.73\% in F1-score.},

@article{middlehurstBakeReduxReview2024,
 abstract = {In 2017, a research paper compared 18 Time Series Classification (TSC) algorithms on 85 datasets from the University of California, Riverside (UCR) archive. This study, commonly referred to as a `bake off', identified that only nine algorithms performed significantly better than the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Rotation Forest benchmarks that were used. The study categorised each algorithm by the type of feature they extract from time series data, forming a taxonomy of five main algorithm types. This categorisation of algorithms alongside the provision of code and accessible results for reproducibility has helped fuel an increase in popularity of the TSC field. Over six years have passed since this bake off, the UCR archive has expanded to 112 datasets and there have been a large number of new algorithms proposed. We revisit the bake off, seeing how each of the proposed categories have advanced since the original publication, and evaluate the performance of newer algorithms against the previous best-of-category using an expanded UCR archive. We extend the taxonomy to include three new categories to reflect recent developments. Alongside the originally proposed distance, interval, shapelet, dictionary and hybrid based algorithms, we compare newer convolution and feature based algorithms as well as deep learning approaches. We introduce 30 classification datasets either recently donated to the archive or reformatted to the TSC format, and use these to further evaluate the best performing algorithm from each category. Overall, we find that two recently proposed algorithms, Hydra+MultiROCKET and HIVE-COTEv2, perform significantly better than other approaches on both the current and new TSC problems.},

Given the current advances in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision, automation of visual quality control is possible and can be a reliable solution. Current methods that achieve state-of-the-art anomaly detection results often use features of different scales extracted from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN). We propose employing multiple feature sets of the same scale alongside a normalizing flow model designed specifically for such sets. Such input features allow the creation of significantly smaller flow models with faster inference. We managed to achieve a decrease of up to 77.5\% in the number of flow model parameters and 63.6\% in inference time while still accomplishing results better than all other flow models and all but one non-flow method. Experimental evaluation on publicly available MVTec AD and MTD datasets showed a state-of-the-art level of performance of our models, thus proving that it is not necessary to use different scales to detect anomalies of different sizes.

 abstract = {Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been extensively deployed to monitor environments. Sensor nodes are susceptible to fault generation due to hardware and software failures in harsh environments. Anomaly detection for the time-series streaming data of sensor nodes is a challenging but critical fault diagnosis task, particularly in large-scale WSNs. The data-driven approach is becoming essential for the goal of improving the reliability and stability of WSNs. We propose a data-driven anomaly detection approach in this paper, named median filter (MF)-stacked long short-term memory-exponentially weighted moving average (LSTM-EWMA), for time-series status data, including the operating voltage and panel temperature recorded by a sensor node deployed in the field. These status data can be used to diagnose device anomalies. First, a median filter (MF) is introduced as a preprocessor to preprocess obvious anomalies in input data. Then, stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed for prediction. Finally, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart is employed as a detector for recognizing anomalies. We evaluate the proposed approach for the panel temperature and operating voltage of time-series streaming data recorded by wireless node devices deployed in harsh field conditions for environmental monitoring. Extensive experiments were conducted on real time-series status data. The results demonstrate that compared to other approaches, the MF-stacked LSTM-EWMA approach can significantly improve the detection rate (DR) and false rate (FR). The average DR and FR values with the proposed approach are 95.46\% and 4.42\%, respectively. MF-stacked LSTM-EWMA anomaly detection also achieves a better F2 score than that achieved by other methods. The proposed approach provides valuable insights for anomaly detection in WSNs by detecting anomalies in the time-series status data recorded by wireless sensor nodes.},

Dozens of distance-based, density-based, kernel-based, and cluster-based algorithms have been proposed in the area of anomaly detection. Recently, because of the robustness of the deep neural networks (DNN), different deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have also been proposed. With all these rapid developments, there exists a small number of comparative studies for anomaly detection methods. Even in those studies, the comparison is done only in typical anomaly detection settings without taking the streaming data into consideration. The presence of intrinsic time-series characteristics like trend, seasonality, and changepoint makes it important to study the behavior of commonly used anomaly detection methods on streaming data. Moreover, the comparison of traditional methods with deep learning-based methods also brings exciting insights about the data which are generally overlooked by traditional methods. In this study, we compare 13 anomaly detection methods on two commonly used streaming data sets. We used four different evaluation metrics to evaluate the methods from different perspectives. Our analysis reveals that the deep learning-based anomaly detection methods are superior to traditional anomaly detection methods.},

@article{munirDeepAnTDeepLearning2019,
 abstract = {Traditional distance and density-based anomaly detection techniques are unable to detect periodic and seasonality related point anomalies which occur commonly in streaming data, leaving a big gap in time series anomaly detection in the current era of the IoT. To address this problem, we present a novel deep learning-based anomaly detection approach (DeepAnT) for time series data, which is equally applicable to the non-streaming cases. DeepAnT is capable of detecting a wide range of anomalies, i.e., point anomalies, contextual anomalies, and discords in time series data. In contrast to the anomaly detection methods where anomalies are learned, DeepAnT uses unlabeled data to capture and learn the data distribution that is used to forecast the normal behavior of a time series. DeepAnT consists of two modules: time series predictor and anomaly detector. The time series predictor module uses deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the next time stamp on the defined horizon. This module takes a window of time series (used as a context) and attempts to predict the next time stamp. The predicted value is then passed to the anomaly detector module, which is responsible for tagging the corresponding time stamp as normal or abnormal. DeepAnT can be trained even without removing the anomalies from the given data set. Generally, in deep learningbased approaches, a lot of data are required to train a model. Whereas in DeepAnT, a model can be trained on relatively small data set while achieving good generalization capabilities due to the effective parameter sharing of the CNN. As the anomaly detection in DeepAnT is unsupervised, it does not rely on anomaly labels at the time of model generation. Therefore, this approach can be directly applied to real-life scenarios where it is practically impossible to label a big stream of data coming from heterogeneous sensors comprising of both normal as well as anomalous points. We have performed a detailed evaluation of 15 algorithms on 10 anomaly detection benchmarks, which contain a total of 433 real and synthetic time series. Experiments show that DeepAnT outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods in most of the cases, while performing on par with others.},

@article{munirFuseADUnsupervisedAnomaly2019,
 abstract = {The need for robust unsupervised anomaly detection in streaming data is increasing rapidly in the current era of smart devices, where enormous data are gathered from numerous sensors. These sensors record the internal state of a machine, the external environment, and the interaction of machines with other machines and humans. It is of prime importance to leverage this information in order to minimize downtime of machines, or even avoid downtime completely by constant monitoring. Since each device generates a different type of streaming data, it is normally the case that a specific kind of anomaly detection technique performs better than the others depending on the data type. For some types of data and use-cases, statistical anomaly detection techniques work better, whereas for others, deep learning-based techniques are preferred. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection technique, FuseAD, which takes advantage of both statistical and deep-learning-based approaches by fusing them together in a residual fashion. The obtained results show an increase in area under the curve (AUC) as compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when FuseAD is tested on a publicly available dataset (Yahoo Webscope benchmark). The obtained results advocate that this fusion-based technique can obtain the best of both worlds by combining their strengths and complementing their weaknesses. We also perform an ablation study to quantify the contribution of the individual components in FuseAD, i.e., the statistical ARIMA model as well as the deep-learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model.},

The autoencoder captures local structural patterns in short embeddings, while the attention model learns long-term features, facilitating parallel computing with positional encoding. Unique in its approach, our proposed hybrid model combines attention and autoencoder for the first time in time series anomaly detection. It employs an attention-based mechanism, akin to the deep transformer model, with key architectural modifications for predicting the next time step window in the autoencoder's latent space. The model utilizes a threshold from the validation dataset for anomaly detection and introduces an alternative method based on analyzing the first statistical moment of error, improving accuracy without dependence on a validation dataset. Evaluation on diverse real-world benchmark datasets and comparing with other well-established models, confirms the effectiveness of our proposed model in anomaly detection.},

@inproceedings{namBreakingTimeFrequencyGranularity2024,
 abstract = {In light of the remarkable advancements made in time-series anomaly detection (TSAD), recent emphasis has been placed on exploiting the frequency domain as well as the time domain to address the difficulties in precisely detecting pattern-wise anomalies. However, in terms of anomaly scores, the window granularity of the frequency domain is inherently distinct from the data-point granularity of the time domain. Owing to this discrepancy, the anomaly information in the frequency domain has not been utilized to its full potential for TSAD. In this paper, we propose a TSAD framework, Dual-TF , that simultaneously uses both the time and frequency domains while breaking the time-frequency granularity discrepancy. To this end, our framework employs nested-sliding windows, with the outer and inner windows responsible for the time and frequency domains, respectively, and aligns the anomaly scores of the two domains. As a result of the high resolution of the aligned scores, the boundaries of pattern-wise anomalies can be identified more precisely. In six benchmark datasets, our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.0--147\%, as demonstrated by experimental results.},

Examples of these FWGs include the engine system, transmission, fuel system, brakes, etc. Each FWG has associated sensorchannels that gauge vehicular operating conditions. This data rich environment is conducive to the development of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) technologies. Undercutting various PdM technologies is the need for robust anomaly detection models that can identify events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal vehicular operational behavior. In this paper, we introduce the Vehicle Performance, Reliability, and Operations (VePRO) dataset and use it to create a multi-phased approach to anomaly detection. Utilizing Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN), our anomaly detection system can achieve 96\% detection accuracy and accurately predicts 91\% of true anomalies.

@misc{nieTimeSeriesWorth2023,
 abstract = {We propose an efficient design of Transformer-based models for multivariate time series forecasting and self-supervised representation learning. It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pretraining tasks and attain excellent fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-trained representation on one dataset to others also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy.},

Commonly known as grid-tied or on-grid solar systems, these configurations enable panels to feed electrical energy back into the grid, offering simplicity, low operating and maintenance costs, and reduced electricity bills. Despite these advantages, this environmentally friendly energy solution is still susceptible to downtimes and faults. This study utilizes advanced machine learning tree-based algorithms for fault detection and diagnosis in such systems with the goal of maintaining reliability, improving performance, and ensuring optimal energy generation. Specifically, the research investigates the effectiveness of Extra Trees as a fault detection and diagnosis algorithm through an efficient two-phase framework that consists of a binary fault detection phase followed by a multi-class fault diagnosis phase, achieving respective accuracies of 99.5\% and 98.7\%. In addition, the study underscores the importance of oversampling in improving results, particularly for imbalanced datasets. Moreover, explainable artificial intelligence is employed to enhance transparency in the model's output and sensitivity to specific features in a given order. Remarkably, the findings align directly with results obtained from techniques such as feature importance averaging and incremental feature accuracy tracking.

@article{panLiftingNetNovelDeep2018,
 abstract = {The key challenge of intelligent fault diagnosis is to develop features that can distinguish different categories. Because of the unique properties of mechanical data, predetermined features based on prior knowledge are usually used as inputs for fault classification. However, proper selection of features often requires expertise knowledge and becomes more difficult and time consuming when volume of data increases. In this paper, a novel deep learning network (LiftingNet) is proposed to learn features adaptively from raw mechanical data without prior knowledge. Inspired by convolutional neural network and second generation wavelet transform, the LiftingNet is constructed to classify mechanical data even though inputs contain considerable noise and randomness. The LiftingNet consists of split layer, predict layer, update layer, pooling layer, and fullconnection layer. Different kernel sizes are allowed in convolutional layers to improve learning ability. As a multilayer neural network, deep features are learned from shallow ones to represent complex structures in raw data. Feasibility and effectiveness of the LiftingNet is validated by two motor bearing datasets. Results show that the proposed method could achieve layerwise feature learning and successfully classify mechanical data even with different rotating speed and under the influence of random noise.},

Two main data-driven approaches are used in the literature to determine the Remaining Useful Life (RUL): direct calculation from raw data and indirect analysis by revealing the transitions from one latent state to another and highlighting degradation in a system's Health Indices. The present study discusses the state-of-theart data-driven methods introduced for RUL prediction in predictive maintenance, by looking at their capabilities, scalability, performance, and weaknesses.

@article{raoSpeedAdaptiveGate2023,
 abstract = {Rotating machines like wind turbines often work under varying speed conditions. Faults may occur in these machines as time goes on. It is important to detect faults early and classify the type and the severity of an occurred fault, so that timely maintenance could be scheduled. This paper attempts to improve the fault clas\- sification accuracy of existing deep learning models when they are used for the fault classification of rotating machinery that operates under varying speed conditions. To achieve this goal, we firstly investigate the effects of speed variation from the perspective of deep learning. We find that the fault information in vibration signals is imbalanced due to speed variation. The imbalance future deteriorates the fault classification accuracy of deep learning models. That is, the accuracy does not evenly distribute across speed but increases with speed. We then propose an auxiliary branch named speed adaptive gate (SAG) for existing deep learning models to address the speed induced fault information imbalance. The SAG takes the speed signal as the input and outputs speed adaptive gate values. The gate values control the information flow of deep learning models so that the effects of speed variation are mitigated. Case studies with two baseline models, i.e., a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a residual network (ResNet), over two experimental datasets, i.e., a planetary gearbox dataset and a fixedshaft gearbox dataset, have validated the effectiveness of the proposed SAG and its superiority over existing approaches.},

They communicate with the cloud and will use Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to exchange warning messages and perform cooperative actions such as platooning. Vehicles have already been attacked and will become even more attractive targets due to their increasing connectivity, the amount of data they produce and their importance to our society. It is therefore crucial to provide cyber security measures to prevent and limit the impact of attacks. As it is problematic for a vehicle to reliably assess its own state when it is compromised, we investigate how vehicle trust can be used to identify compromised vehicles and how fleet-wide attacks can be detected at an early stage using cloud data. In our proposed V2C Anomaly Detection framework, peer vehicles assess each other based on their perceived behavior in traffic and V2X-enabled interactions, and upload these assessments to the cloud for analysis. This framework consists of four modules. For each module we define functional demands, interfaces and evaluate solutions proposed in literature allowing manufacturers and fleet owners to choose appropriate techniques. We detail attack scenarios where this type of framework is particularly useful in detecting and identifying potential attacks and failing software and hardware. Furthermore, we describe what basic vehicle data the cloud analysis can be based upon.},

 abstract = {Sensors' existence as a key component of Cyber-Physical Systems makes it susceptible to failures due to complex environments, low-quality production, and aging. When defective, sensors either stop communicating or convey incorrect information. These unsteady situations threaten the safety, economy, and reliability of a system. The objective of this study is to construct a lightweight machine learning-based fault detection and diagnostic system within the limited energy resources, memory, and computation of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In this paper, a ContextAware Fault Diagnostic (CAFD) scheme is proposed based on an ensemble learning algorithm called Extra-Trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, a realistic WSN scenario composed of humidity and temperature sensor observations is replicated with extreme low-intensity faults. Six commonly occurring types of sensor fault are considered: drift, hard-over/bias, spike, erratic/precision degradation, stuck, and data-loss. The proposed CAFD scheme reveals the ability to accurately detect and diagnose low-intensity sensor faults in a timely manner. Moreover, the efficiency of the Extra-Trees algorithm in terms of diagnostic accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and training time is demonstrated by comparison with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms: a Support Vector Machine and a Neural Network.},

In addition, determining the degree of bearing degeneration will aid firms in scheduling maintenance. Maintenance engineers may be gradually supplanted by an automated detection technique in identifying motor issues as improvements in the extraction of useful information from vibration signals are made. State-of-the-art deep learning approaches, in particular, have made a considerable contribution to automatic defect identification. Under variable shaft speed, this research presents a novel approach for identifying bearing defects and their amount of degradation. In the proposed approach, vibration signals are represented by spectrograms, and deep learning methods are applied via pre-processing with the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). A convolutional neural network (CNN), VGG16, is then used to extract features and classify health status. After this, RUL prediction is carried out with the use of regression. Explainable AI using LIME was used to identify the part of the image used by the CNN algorithm to give the output.

@article{shipmonTimeSeriesAnomaly2017,
 abstract = {Google uses continuous streams of data from industry partners in order to deliver accurate results to users. Unexpected drops in traffic can be an indication of an underlying issue and may be an early warning that remedial action may be necessary. Detecting such drops is non-trivial because streams are variable and noisy, with roughly regular spikes (in many different shapes) in traffic data. We investigated the question of whether or not we can predict anomalies in these data streams. Our goal is to utilize Machine Learning and statistical approaches to classify anomalous drops in periodic, but noisy, traffic patterns. Since we do not have a large body of labeled examples to directly apply supervised learning for anomaly classification, we approached the problem in two parts. First we used TensorFlow to train our various models including DNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs to perform regression and predict the expected value in the time series. Secondly we created anomaly detection rules that compared the actual values to predicted values. Since the problem requires finding sustained anomalies, rather than just short delays or momentary inactivity in the data, our two detection methods focused on continuous sections of activity rather than just single points. We tried multiple combinations of our models and rules and found that using the intersection of our two anomaly detection methods proved to be an effective method of detecting anomalies on almost all of our models. In the process we also found that not all data fell within our experimental assumptions, as one data stream had no periodicity, and therefore no time based model could predict it.},

 abstract = {Fault diagnosis is very important to the modern manufacturing system. As a powerful data-driven method, machine learning (ML) has been widely used for fault diagnosis. However, a certain amount of labelled data is essential to most of the ML methods, which is not always available. In this study, an unsupervised fault diagnosis method based on iterative multi-manifold spectral clustering (IMMSC) is proposed. The IMMSC, that the affinity matrix is constructed based on local tangent space, can improve the performance of spectral clustering on multi-manifold distributed data. The IMMSC is conducted after feature extraction to divide data into different clusters first. Then local outlier factor is utilised to identify the normal condition. A fault index is found to recognise the fault conditions. The proposed IMMSC is tested on five simulation datasets and the proposed method is validated on the motor bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University. The mean accuracy of IMMSC on simulation data is 97.85\%, which outperforms the other spectral clustering and traditional methods. Furthermore, the result of the IMMSC is stable over 30 individual tests. The mean accuracy of the proposed method on motor bearing dataset is 98.53\%. The result demonstrates its potential in fault diagnosis field.},

Therefore, implementing a system that can automatically detect faults at an early stage and recommend stopping of a machine to avoid unsafe condi\- tions in the process and environment has become possible. This paper proposes the use of Predictive Maintenance model with Convolutional Neural Network (PdM-CNN), to classify automatically rotating equipment faults and advise when maintenance actions should be taken. This work uses data from only one vibration sensor installed on the motor-drive end bearing, which is the most common layout present in the industry. This work was developed under controlled ambient varying rotational speeds, load levels and severities, in order to verify whether it is possible to build a model capable of classifying such faults in rotating machinery using only one set of vibration sensors. The results showed that the accuracies of the PdM-CNN model were of 99.58\% and 97.3\%, when applied to two different publicly available databases. This demonstrates the model's ability to accurately detect and classify faults in industrial rotating machinery. With this model companies can improve the financial performance of their rotating machine monitoring through reducing sensor acquisition costs for fault identifi\- cation and classification problems, easing their way towards the digital transformation required for the fourth industrial revolution.},

 abstract = {Distributed control systems (DCS) are essential to operate complex industrial processes. A major part of a DCS is the alarm system, which helps plant operators to keep the processes stable and safe. Alarms are defined as threshold values on individual signals taking into account minimum reaction time of the human operator. In reality, however, alarms are often noisy and overwhelming, and thus can be easily overlooked by the operators. Early alarm prediction can give the operator more time to react and introduce corrective actions to avoid downtime and negative impact on human safety and the environment. In this context, we introduce Alarm Prediction Transformer (APT), a multimodal Transformer-based machine learning model for early alarm prediction based on the combination of recent events and signal data. Specifically, we propose two novel fusion strategies and three methods of label encoding with various levels of granularity. Given a window of several minutes of event logs and signal data, our model predicts whether an alarm is going to be triggered after a few minutes and, if yes, it also predicts its location. Our experiments on two novel real industrial plant data sets and a simulated data set show that the model is capable of predicting alarms with the given horizon and that our proposed fusion technique combining inputs from different modalities, i. e. events and signals, yields more accurate results than any of the modalities alone or conventional fusion techniques.},

@article{sunUnsupervisedSpatioTemporalState,
 abstract = {Accurate detection and diagnosis of abnormal behaviors such as network attacks from multivariate time series (MTS) are crucial for ensuring the stable and effective operation of industrial cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, existing researches pay little attention to the logical dependencies among system working states, and have difficulties in explaining the evolution mechanisms of abnormal signals. To reveal the spatio-temporal association relationships and evolution mechanisms of the working states of industrial CPS, this paper proposes a fine-grained adaptive anomaly diagnosis method (i.e. MAD-Transformer) to identify and diagnose anomalies in MTS. MAD-Transformer first constructs a temporal state matrix to characterize and estimate the change patterns of the system states in the temporal dimension. Then, to better locate the anomalies, a spatial state matrix is also constructed to capture the inter-sensor state correlation relationships within the system. Subsequently, based on these two types of state matrices, a three-branch structure of series-temporal-spatial attention module is designed to simultaneously capture the series, temporal, and space dependencies among MTS. Afterwards, three associated alignment loss functions and a reconstruction loss are constructed to jointly optimize the model. Finally, anomalies are determined and diagnosed by comparing the residual matrices with the original matrices. We conducted comparative experiments on five publicly datasets spanning three application domains (service monitoring, spatial and earth exploration, and water treatment), along with a petroleum refining simulation dataset collected by ourselves. The results demonstrate that MAD-Transformer can adaptively detect fine-grained anomalies with short duration, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of noise robustness and localization performance.},

@article{thillTemporalConvolutionalAutoencoder2021,
 abstract = {Learning temporal patterns in time series remains a challenging task up until today. Particularly for anomaly detection in time series, it is essential to learn the underlying structure of a system's normal behavior. Periodic or quasiperiodic signals with complex temporal patterns make the problem even more challenging: Anomalies may be a hard-to-detect deviation from the normal recurring pattern. In this paper, we present TCN-AE, a temporal convolutional network autoencoder based on dilated convolutions. Contrary to many other anomaly detection algorithms, TCN-AE is trained in an unsupervised manner. The algorithm demonstrates its efficacy on a comprehensive real-world anomaly benchmark comprising electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients with cardiac arrhythmia. TCNAE significantly outperforms several other unsupervised state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. Moreover, we investigate the contribution of the individual enhancements and show that each new ingredient improves the overall performance on the investigated benchmark.},

@misc{tuliTranADDeepTransformer2022,
 abstract = {Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate timeseries data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attentionbased sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17\%, reducing training times by up to 99\% compared to the baselines.},

Really good paper that uses transformers for anomaly detection in multivariate time series with an adversarial training (autoencoder architecture but with 2 decoders) in 2 phases. First phase is reconstruction using L2 (MSE). 2nd phase is using deviations as input too to highlight deviations. It uses the complete sequence until current timestamp + a window. As preprocessing uses normalization with min-max scaling. Then divides sequences into sliding windows (with padding to maintain window length) for faster training and inference. That way it has 'knowledge' of the full sequence + local information of the window. It is then predicting an anomaly score per each window. It is also reconstructing the time series per window and using the deviation from the original window as what it calls a focus score to feed the encoder again},

@article{tutivenEarlyFaultDiagnosis2022,
 abstract = {To reduce the levelized cost of wind energy, through the reduction in operation and maintenance costs, it is imperative that the wind turbine downtime is reduced through maintenance strategies based on condition monitoring. The standard approach toward this challenge is based on vibration monitoring, which requires the installation of specific tailored sensors that incur associated added costs. On the other hand, the life expectancy of wind parks built during the 1990s wind power boom is dwindling, and data-driven maintenance strategies issued from already accessible supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data is an auspicious competitive solution because no additional sensors are required. Note that it is a major issue to provide fault diagnosis approaches built only on SCADA data, as these data were not established with the objective of being used for condition monitoring but rather for control capacities. The present study posits an early fault diagnosis strategy based exclusively on SCADA data and supports it with results on a real wind park with 18 wind turbines. The contributed methodology is an anomaly detection model based on a one-class support vector machine classifier; that is, it is a semi-supervised approach that trains a decision function that categorizes fresh data as similar or dissimilar to the training set. Therefore, only healthy (normal operation) data is required to train the model, which greatly expands the possibility of employing this methodology (because there is no need for faulty data from the past, and only normal operation SCADA data is needed). The results obtained from the real wind park show that this is a promising strategy.},

@article{uAIPoweredIoTSurvey2025,
 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) enabled IoT is a significant paradigm that has been proliferating to new heights in recent years. IoT is a smart technology in which the physical objects or the things that are ubiquitously around us are networked and linked to the internet to deliver new services and enhance efficiency. The primary objective of the IoT is to connect all the physical objects or the things of the world under a common infrastructure, allowing humans to control them and get timely, frequent updates on their status. These things or devices connected to IoT generate, gather and process a massive volume of binary data. This massive volume of data generated from these devices is analyzed and learned by AI algorithms and techniques that aid in providing users with better services. Thus, AI-enabled IoT or artificial IoT (AIoT) is a hybrid technology that merges AI with IoT and is capable of simplifying complicated and strenuous tasks with ease and efficiency. The various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in IoT are necessary to ensure the IoT network's improved security and confidentiality. Furthermore, this paper also surveys the various architectures that form the backbone of IoT and AIoT. Moreover, the myriad state-of-the-art ML and DL-based approaches for securing IoT, including detecting anomalies/intrusions, authentication and access control, attack detection and mitigation, preventing distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, and analyzing malware in IoT, are also enlightened. In addition, this work also reviews the role of AIoT in optimizing network efficiency, securing IoT infrastructures, and addressing key challenges. Furthermore, it explores cutting-edge technologies like blockchain, 6Genabled AIoT, federated learning (FL), and hyperdimensional (HD) computing, indicating their potential in advancing IoT and AIoT-driven applications within sectors like healthcare, autonomous systems, and industrial automation. Therefore, based on the plethora of prevailing significant works, the objective of this manuscript is to provide a comprehensive survey that expounds on AIoT in terms of security, architecture, applications, emerging technologies, and challenges.},

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 Englishto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

@article{veerappaValidationXAIExplanations2022,
 abstract = {Due to the lack of explanation towards their internal mechanism, state-of-the-art deep learning-based classifiers are often considered as black-box models. For instance, in the maritime domain, models that classify the types of ships based on their trajectories and other features perform well, but give no further explanation for their predictions. To gain the trust of human operators responsible for critical decisions, the reason behind the clas\- sification is crucial. In this paper, we introduce explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) approaches to the task of classification of ship types. This supports decision-making by providing explanations in terms of the features contributing the most towards the prediction, along with their corresponding time intervals. In the case of the LIME explainer, we adapt the time-slice mapping technique (LimeforTime), while for Shapley additive expla\- nations (SHAP) and path integrated gradient (PIG), we represent the relevance of each input variable to generate a heatmap as an explanation. In order to validate the XAI results, the existing perturbation and sequence analyses for classifiers of univariate time series data is employed for testing and evaluating the XAI explanations on multivariate time series. Furthermore, we introduce a novel evaluation technique to assess the quality of ex\- planations yielded by the chosen XAI method.},

Such models have been extensively applied to perform anomaly detection tasks, with the express purpose of detecting data patterns that deviate significantly from normal operational behaviour. Due to its preeminent importance in the maritime industry to adequately identify the behaviour of marine systems, the Real-time Anomaly Detection Intelligent System (RADIS) framework, constituted by a Long Short-Term Memory-based Variational Autoencoder in tandem with multi-level Otsu's thresholding, is proposed. RADIS aims to address the current gaps identified within the maritime industry in relation to data-driven model applications for enabling smart maintenance. To assess the performance of such a framework, a case study on a total of 14 parameters obtained from sensors installed on a diesel generator of a tanker ship is introduced to highlight the implementation of RADIS. Results demonstrated the capability of RADIS to be part of a diagnostic analytics tool that will promote the implementation of smart maintenance within the maritime industry, as RADIS detected an average of 92.5\% of anomalous instances in the presented case study.},

@article{venkatasubramanianReviewProcessFault2003,
 abstract = {Fault detection and diagnosis is an important problem in process engineering. It is the central component of abnormal event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention recently. AEM deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid abnormal event progression and reduce productivity loss. Since the petrochemical industries lose an estimated 20 billion dollars every year, they have rated AEM as their number one problem that needs to be solved. Hence, there is considerable interest in this field now from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as opposed to a decade or so ago. There is an abundance of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modelling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the spectrum, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historic process data. In addition, given the process knowledge, there are different search techniques that can be applied to perform diagnosis. Such a collection of bewildering array of methodologies and alternatives often poses a difficult challenge to any aspirant who is not a specialist in these techniques. Some of these ideas seem so far apart from one another that a non-expert researcher or practitioner is often left wondering about the suitability of a method for his or her diagnostic situation. While there have been some excellent reviews in this field in the past, they often focused on a particular branch, such as analytical models, of this broad discipline. The basic aim of this three part series of papers is to provide a systematic and comparative study of various diagnostic methods from different perspectives. We broadly classify fault diagnosis methods into three general categories and review them in three parts. They are quantitative model-based methods, qualitative model-based methods, and process history based methods. In the first part of the series, the problem of fault diagnosis is introduced and approaches based on quantitative models are reviewed. In the remaining two parts, methods based on qualitative models and process history data are reviewed. Furthermore, these disparate methods will be compared and evaluated based on a common set of criteria introduced in the first part of the series. We conclude the series with a discussion on the relationship of fault diagnosis to other process operations and on emerging trends such as hybrid blackboard-based frameworks for fault diagnosis.},

 abstract = {Wind power generation is one of the important development projects for renewable energy worldwide. As wind turbines operate in harsh environments, failure of the wind turbines often occurs, thus leading to lower power generation efficiency and high maintenance cost. Earlier detection of the fault type can reduce the maintenance cost. This study proposed a hybrid recognition algorithm based on the symmetrized dot pattern (SDP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) for wind turbine gearbox fault diagnoses. In addition to a fault-free type, four fault types were discussed in this paper, including gear rustiness, broken tooth, wear, and aging. A vibration sensor was used for measurement. The original vibration signals of the gearbox were captured by a NI-9234 high-speed data acquisition card, filtered by a fast Fourier transform, and imported into the SDP to create the snowflake image features. Afterward, CNN diagnosed the gearbox fault type. There were 1500 test data in this study. A total of 200 data items for each fault type were used as training samples, and 100 data of each type were used as test samples. The test result shows that the training accuracy was 98.8\%. The proposed method can diagnose the fault condition of the gearbox effectively and identify the fault type of the gearbox accurately. This is favorable for the quick maintenance of wind turbines.},

The CSAE adds Gaussian stochastic unit into activation function to extract features of nonlinear data. In this paper, CSAE is applied to solve the problem of transformer fault recognition. Firstly, based on dissolved gas analysis method, IEC three ratios are calculated by the concentrations of dissolved gases. Then IEC three ratios data is normalized to reduce data singularity and improve training speed. Secondly, deep belief network is established by two layers of CSAE and one layer of back propagation (BP) network. Thirdly, CSAE is adopted to unsupervised training and getting features.

 abstract = {Time series anomaly detection through unsupervised methods has been an active research area in recent years due to its enormous potential for networks management. The representation and reconstruction of time series have made extraordinary progress in existing works. However, time series is known to be complex in terms of their temporal dependency and stochasticity, which makes anomaly detection difficult. To this end, we propose a novel approach based on a decomposition auto-transformer networks(DATN) for time series anomaly detection. The time series is decomposed into seasonal and trend components, and renovated as a basic inner block deep model. With this design, transformers can decompose complex time series in a progressive manner. We also design an auto-transfomer block that determines dependencies and representation aggregation at the sub-series level based on series seasonal and trend components. Moreover, the complex transformer decoder is replaced by a simple linear decoder, which makes the model more efficient. Extensive experiments on various public benchmarks demonstrate that our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance.},

 abstract = {Unsupervised detection of anomaly points in time series is a challenging problem, which requires the model to derive a distinguishable criterion. Previous methods tackle the problem mainly through learning pointwise representation or pairwise association, however, neither is sufficient to reason about the intricate dynamics. Recently, Transformers have shown great power in unified modeling of pointwise representation and pairwise association, and we find that the self-attention weight distribution of each time point can embody rich association with the whole series. Our key observation is that due to the rarity of anomalies, it is extremely difficult to build nontrivial associations from abnormal points to the whole series, thereby, the anomalies' associations shall mainly concentrate on their adjacent time points. This adjacent-concentration bias implies an association-based criterion inherently distinguishable between normal and abnormal points, which we highlight through the Association Discrepancy. Technically, we propose the Anomaly Transformer with a new Anomaly-Attention mechanism to compute the association discrepancy. A minimax strategy is devised to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy. The Anomaly Transformer achieves state-of-theart results on six unsupervised time series anomaly detection benchmarks of three applications: service monitoring, space \& earth exploration, and water treatment.},

Meanwhile, the common intelligent diagnosis methods have low accuracy, poor generalization ability and difficulty in processing high-dimensional data. This paper proposes a method of fault feature extraction for motor based on the principle of stacked denoising autoencoder (SDAE) combined with the support vector machine (SVM) classifier. First, the motor signals collected from the experiment were processed, and the input data were randomly damaged by adding noise. Furthermore, according to the experimental results, the network structure of stacked denoising autoencoder was constructed, the optimal learning rate, noise reduction coefficient and the other network parameters were set. Finally, the trained network was used to verify the test samples. Compared with the traditional fault extraction method and single autoencoder method, this method has the advantages of better accuracy, strong generalization ability and easy-to-deal-with high-dimensional data features.},

Faulty data samples are usually more difficult for collection than normal operation data. Existing works show that the generative adversarial networks (GAN) are useful generating synthetic faulty data samples to enrich the training dataset. However, it remains a problem for the automated FDD applications to select high-quality synthetic faulty samples generated by GAN. The FDD accuracy becomes unstable when the quality of synthetic fault data samples cannot be controlled entirely. In this study, we proposed to use the classic definition of anomaly detection to select high-quality synthetic fault data samples with the generative adversarial networks. Two anomaly detection methods were investigated, including the traditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the GANomaly. Through a series of experiments, it is justified that, with a small amount of real fault data, the proposed GANbased chiller FDD framework with GANomaly achieves the highest FDD accuracy than all compared methods.},

 abstract = {Automating the monitoring of industrial processes has the potential to enhance efficiency and optimize quality by promptly detecting abnormal events and thus facilitating timely interventions. Deep learning, with its capacity to discern non-trivial patterns within large datasets, plays a pivotal role in this process. Standard deep learning methods are suitable to solve a specific task given a specific type of data. During training, deep learning demands large volumes of labeled data. However, due to the dynamic nature of the industrial processes and environment, it is impractical to acquire large-scale labeled data for standard deep learning training for every slightly different case anew. Deep transfer learning offers a solution to this problem. By leveraging knowledge from related tasks and accounting for variations in data distributions, the transfer learning framework solves new tasks with little or even no additional labeled data. The approach bypasses the need to retrain a model from scratch for every new setup and dramatically reduces the labeled data requirement. This survey first provides an in-depth review of deep transfer learning, examining the problem settings of transfer learning and classifying the prevailing deep transfer learning methods. Moreover, we delve into applications of deep transfer learning in the context of a broad spectrum of time series anomaly detection tasks prevalent in primary industrial domains, e.g., manufacturing process monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy management, and infrastructure facility monitoring. We discuss the challenges and limitations of deep transfer learning in industrial contexts and conclude the survey with practical directions and actionable suggestions to address the need to leverage diverse time series data for anomaly detection in an increasingly dynamic production environment.},

@misc{yangDDMTDenoisingDiffusion2023,
 abstract = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has emerged as a crucial challenge in time series research, with significant research implications in various fields such as fraud detection, fault diagnosis, and system state estimation. Reconstruction-based models have shown promising potential in recent years for detecting anomalies in time series data. However, due to the rapid increase in data scale and dimensionality, the issues of noise and Weak Identity Mapping (WIM) during time series reconstruction have become increasingly pronounced. To address this, we introduce a novel Adaptive Dynamic Neighbor Mask (ADNM) mechanism and integrate it with the Transformer and Denoising Diffusion Model, creating a new framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection, named Denoising Diffusion Mask Transformer (DDMT). The ADNM module is introduced to mitigate information leakage between input and output features during data reconstruction, thereby alleviating the problem of WIM during reconstruction. The Denoising Diffusion Transformer (DDT) employs the Transformer as an internal neural network structure for Denoising Diffusion Model. It learns the stepwise generation process of time series data to model the probability distribution of the data, capturing normal data patterns and progressively restoring time series data by removing noise, resulting in a clear recovery of anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that combines Denoising Diffusion Model and the Transformer for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Experimental evaluations were conducted on five publicly available multivariate time series anomaly detection datasets. The results demonstrate that the model effectively identifies anomalies in time series data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.},

 abstract = {In industrial applications, different abnormal conditions of a machine or a machinery fleet typically occur sequentially instead of becoming initially known. Therefore, one of the most challenging tasks for the machinery fault diagnosis is to incrementally classify unknown abnormal patterns. For this reason, an incremental novelty identification (INI) method is proposed, on the strength of deep learningbased representation learning, novelty detection and incremental learning. In the INI framework, a convolutional neural network autoencoder is first developed for high-level feature extraction from multiple monitoring signals. An online sequential-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is then proposed to learn healthy features of the normal condition initially known. The newly collected data are employed for updating the OS-ELM with the quantification of the model modification for novelty detection. An incremental learning procedure is implemented by adding a new OS-ELM model representing the novel abnormal pattern. The repository of OS-ELMs, each of which represents a specific condition, is employed for incrementally diagnosing known abnormal patterns with the identification of unknown ones. The performance of the proposed INI is validated under experimental scenarios considering both a benchmark bearing case study and a delta three-dimensional printer, and the results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.},

Firstly, the basic framework of the SNN method is introduced, and the advantages and application scenarios of the framework are pointed out. Secondly, the existing fault diagnosis methods based on SNN are classified, including the principle of the technique, improved methods, and shortcomings. Finally, the FD methods based on SNN are summarized, and the development of the SNN in FD is in prospect.},

 abstract = {Deep learning methods are promising tools for machinery fault diagnosis in modern industry. However, the diagnostic performance of these methods will deteriorate significantly with insufficient labeled data or varying working condition. To address this problem, a self-supervised learning (SSL) method with self-attention mechanism is proposed for machinery fault diagnosis under limited labeled data and nonstationary working condition. A simple but effective pretext task is first constructed to take full advantage of unlabeled data under varying working condition. By completing the pretext task, a pretrained model is generated for effective feature representation with the constraint of signal masking and reconstruction, thus enhancing the capability of extracting discriminative features. Then, a fine-tuned model, which inherits the capability of feature extraction of pretrained one by knowledge transfer, is built by feeding into few labeled samples. Moreover, with our SSL method, transformer architecture with self-attention mechanism is used as the backbone to enhance the ability of modeling global dependency and extracting temporal information. The experimental results reveal that our method can achieve better diagnostic performance under new working condition by comparing with six advanced methods. Furthermore, a discussion on the capability of reconstruction and the classification effect is performed in this study, which demonstrates the rationality of our designed pretext task.},

 abstract = {Change detection of natural lake boundaries is one of the important tasks in remote sensing image interpretation. In an ordinary fully connected network, or CNN, the signal of neurons in each layer can only be propagated to the upper layer, and the processing of samples is independent at each moment. However, for time-series data with transferability, the learned change information needs to be recorded and utilized. To solve the above problems, we propose a lake boundary change prediction model combining U-Net and LSTM. The ensemble of LSTMs helps to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the model by capturing the spatial and temporal nuances in the data, resulting in more precise predictions. This study selected Lake Urmia as the research area and used the annual panoramic remote sensing images from 1996 to 2014 (Lat: 37{\textopenbullet}00 N to 38{\textopenbullet}15 N, Lon: 46{\textopenbullet}10 E to 44{\textopenbullet}50 E) obtained by Google Earth Professional Edition 7.3 software as the research data set. This model uses the U-Net network to extract multi-level change features and analyze the change trend of lake boundaries. The LSTM module is introduced after U-Net to optimize the predictive model using historical data storage and forgetting as well as current input data. This method enables the model to automatically fit the trend of time series data and mine the deep information of lake boundary changes. Through experimental verification, the model's prediction accuracy for lake boundary changes after training can reach 89.43\%. Comparative experiments with the existing U-Net-STN model show that the U-Net-LSTM model used in this study has higher prediction accuracy and lower mean square error.},

 abstract = {Accurate detection of anomalies in multivariate time series data has attracted much attention due to its importance in a wide range of applications. Since it is difficult to obtain accurately labeled data, many unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms for multivariate time series data have been developed. However, building such a system is challenging since it requires capturing temporal dependencies in each time series and must also encode the inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. To meet this challenge, we propose a Multi Scale Convolutional Variational Autoencoder (MSCVAE) to detect anomalies in multivariate time series data. Firstly, multi scale attribute matrices are constructed from multivariate time series to characterize multiple levels of the system states at different time steps. Then, given the attribute matrices, a convolutional variational autoencoder is employed to generate reconstructed attribute matrices, and also an attention-based ConvLSTM network is used to capture the temporal patterns. In addition, a new ERR-based threshold setting strategy is developed to optimize anomaly detection performance instead of relying on the traditional ROC-based threshold setting strategy with an imbalanced dataset. Finally, the proposed framework is assessed by means of experiments on four datasets. The experimental results show that our proposed framework is superior to competing algorithms in terms of model performance and robustness, demonstrating that our model is effective in detecting anomalies in multivariate time series.},

 abstract = {In modern industrial processes, soft sensors have played an important role for effective process control, optimization, and monitoring. Feature representation is one of the core factors to construct accurate soft sensors. Recently, deep learning techniques have been developed for high-level abstract feature extraction in pattern recognition areas, which also have great potential for soft sensing applications. Hence, deep stacked autoencoder (SAE) is introduced for soft sensor in this paper. As for output prediction purpose, traditional deep learning algorithms cannot extract high-level output-related features. Thus, a novel variable-wise weighted stacked autoencoder (VWSAE) is proposed for hierarchical output-related feature representation layer by layer. By correlation analysis with the output variable, important variables are identified from other ones in the input layer of each autoencoder. The variables are assigned with different weights accordingly. Then, variable-wise weighted autoencoders are designed and stacked to form deep networks. An industrial application shows that the proposed VW-SAE can give better prediction performance than the traditional multilayer neural networks and SAE.},

@misc{yueTS2VecUniversalRepresentation2022,
 abstract = {This paper presents TS2Vec, a universal framework for learning representations of time series in an arbitrary semantic level. Unlike existing methods, TS2Vec performs contrastive learning in a hierarchical way over augmented context views, which enables a robust contextual representation for each timestamp. Furthermore, to obtain the representation of an arbitrary sub-sequence in the time series, we can apply a simple aggregation over the representations of corresponding timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments on time series classification tasks to evaluate the quality of time series representations. As a result, TS2Vec achieves significant improvement over existing SOTAs of unsupervised time series representation on 125 UCR datasets and 29 UEA datasets. The learned timestamp-level representations also achieve superior results in time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. A linear regression trained on top of the learned representations outperforms previous SOTAs of time series forecasting. Furthermore, we present a simple way to apply the learned representations for unsupervised anomaly detection, which establishes SOTA results in the literature.

 abstract = {For PHM(Predictive Health Management) in an industrial scenario, motor vibration anomaly detection requires a large number of labeled data. The problem is that the anomaly vibration signal data is scarce and difficult to be obtained, especially the problem of insufficient data in the building and deployment of multi-machine models. This paper proposes a Meta-learning method based on deep unsupervised learning(Autoencoder). We use non-labeled and a small amount of vibration signal data which is converted into 52 key physical and statistical features to build models of different motors. By inputting these 52 features into designed models, other 52 features can be reconstructed as output. We use input and output features to calculate reconstruction error which is used as the criterion for the performance of models. We also use accuracy as the criterion for the performance of models. In the actual industrial situation, the improvement of accuracy by our proposed method is about 33.50\% better than the method only with unsupervised learning for the new sensor model with few vibration data.},

Therefore, fast and efficient fault detection and diagnosis technique is highly needed to prevent unpredicted power interruptions. This is obtained in this study in the following steps. First, an efficient meta-heuristic algorithm is proposed for extracting the optimal five parameters of the PV model in order to assist the MATLAB simulation model. It is used due to its simplicity and high efficiency in building the PV array simulation. Second, a new PV system deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) fault classification method is presented for the advantage of automatic feature extraction, which reduces the computational burden and increases the high classification capability. Finally, for the practical and theoretical validation of the employed CNN model, normal and six fault cases are selected based on different atmospheric conditions. At same time, three electrical indicators are analysed and accordingly chosen as inputs to the proposed classification model. Moreover, the proposed model is compared with other machine-learning models.},

@article{zhangDeepNeuralNetwork2019,
 abstract = {Nowadays, multivariate time series data are increasingly collected in various real world systems, e.g., power plants, wearable devices, etc. Anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series refer to identifying abnormal status in certain time steps and pinpointing the root causes. Building such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents. Despite the fact that a number of unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms have been developed, few of them can jointly address these challenges. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically, MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps. Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies. Extensive empirical studies based on a synthetic dataset and a real power plant dataset demonstrate that MSCRED can outperform state-ofthe-art baseline methods.},

 abstract = {In recent years, supervised deep learning methods have proven to be feasible and advanced for fault diagnosis. They do, however, rely on large amounts of accurately labeled data. It is challenging to accurately label incipient or secondary fault signals in the presence of operational background noise, resulting in noisy labels. This study presents a bidirectional guidance method that enables deep networks to diagnose faults robustly with the ability to label noise tolerance. First, the proposed method uses discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to preprocess vibration signals before feeding them into the deep convolutional network. Second, a bidirectional loss (BL) function is proposed to significantly improve the robustness of the model in the case of noisy labels. Third, a fast cosine decay (FCD) strategy of the learning rate is designed to further boost the recognition performance of the model under severe noisy labels. The proposed method is applied to testbed experiments and wind turbine fault diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms other cutting-edge methods in fault diagnosis with severely noisy labels.},

Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) is one of the effective techniques to diagnose early faults in oil-immersed transformers.

Researchers have proposed many methods for fault diagnosis, such as double ratio method, Rogers method, Duval triangle method, etc., but all of them have some problems. Based on the strong data mining capability and good robustness of AI techniques, many researchers introduced AI techniques to mine the features of DGA data. According to the characteristics and scale of DGA data, researchers select appropriate AI techniques or make appropriate improvements to AI techniques to improve diagnostic performance. This paper presents a systematic review of the literature on the application of artificial intelligence techniques for DGA-based diagnosis and for solving intractable problems in early transformer fault diagnosis, which include neural networks, clustering, support vector machines, etc. In addition to reviewing the applications of these intelligent techniques, the diagnostic thinking proposed in this literature, such as the introduction of temporal parameters for comprehensive analysis of DGA data and the extraction of optimal features for DGA data, is also reviewed.

In the paper, a novel transformer fault diagnosis method using an Internet of Things (IoT) based monitoring system and an ensemble machine learning (EML) is presented. The monitoring system based on IoT technology consists of two parts: a data measurement subsystem and a data reception subsystem. Firstly, transformer vibration signals are measured by using the data measurement subsystem, and they are sent to the remote server by using the data reception subsystem. Then, an EML composed of deep belief networks (DBNs) and stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAs) with different activation functions, and relevance vector machines (RVMs) is proposed. DBNs and SDAs are respectively used to extract features from the signals, and RVMs are respectively employed as classifier. In order to ensure efficient of the EML, a novel combination strategy is proposed. A transformer fault diagnosis experiment is performed, and the diagnosis results confirm that the designed monitoring system can collect vibration signals effectively and long-distance, and the proposed EML can usefully remedy the inadequate information of features extracted by individual deep learning method, and its RVM classifier is obviously better than other commonly used classifiers.},

 abstract = {Continuous monitoring of wind turbine health using early fault detection methods can improve turbine reliability and reduce maintenance costs before they reach a catastrophic stage. To achieve anomaly detection and fault analysis of wind turbine components, this paper proposes a deep learning method based on a deep auto-encoder (DAE) network using operational supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data of wind turbines. First, a component DAE network model using multiple restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) was constructed. Previously collected normal SCADA data from wind turbines were used to train this multilayer network model layer-wise to extract the relationships between SCADA variables. Then, a reconstruction error (Re) was calculated by using the DAE network input and its output reconstruction value, which was defined as the condition detection index to reflect the component health condition. Due to the acute changes and disturbances of wind speed in actual operation, the calculated detection index always has an extreme distribution that can cause false alarms. Therefore, an adaptive threshold determined by the extreme value theory was proposed and used as the rule of anomaly judgement. The method can not only implement early warning of fault components but also deduce the physical location of a faulted component by DAE residuals. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by some reported failure cases of wind turbine components.},

Electronic devices are of great importance at present, which are popularly applied in daily life. The basis of supporting the electronic device is the powerful electronic chip and its manufacturing technology. Chip manufacturing has been one of the most important technologies in recent years. The etching machine is the key equipment in the etching process of the wafers in chip manufacturing. Due to the high demands for precise manufacturing, monitoring the health state and predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of the etching system is quite important. However, the task is very hard because of the lack of knowledge of exact onset of failure or degradation and the multiple operating conditions, etc. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based RUL prediction method for the etching system. The transformer module and random forest are integrated in the methodology to identify the health state of the machine and predict its RUL, through training with the complex data of the etching machine's sensors and exploring its underlying features. The experiments are based on the subject of the 2018 PHM Data Challenge---for estimating time-to-failure or RUL of Ion Mill Etching Systems in an online fashion using data from multiple sensors. The results indicate the proposed method is promising for the real applications of the prognosis of the etching system for electronic devices.},

@article{zhaoDenoisingDiffusionProbabilistic2025,
 abstract = {Bearing fault is one of the main causes of rotating machinery failure. However, collecting sufficient failure data proves challenging in real-world industrial environments due to their complexity. Owing to this constraint, the majority of current methods fail to accurately identify fault types with limited data, thereby impeding timely maintenance efforts. To address this issue, we propose a bearing fault diagnosis method utilizing diffusion model data enhancement in this study. Following data collection, we employ the continuous wavelet transform to convert various one-dimensional vibration data into two-dimensional time series graphs. Subsequently, these feature graphs are partitioned into sets of fault samples. Then, the diffusion model is employed to augment the training samples. These augmented samples are then fed into the convolutional neural network for fault diag\- nosis, and their diagnostic accuracy is compared with that of the original dataset. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the data augmentation technique, founded on the diffusion model, enhances fault diagnosis accuracy within a small sample training dataset. Ultimately, the efficacy of the proposed method is validated utilizing the Paderborn bearing dataset and juxtaposed against alternative data augmentation techniques. The findings indicate that the diffusion model-based data augmentation method outperforms other techniques in terms of both training accuracy and stability, particularly in scenarios with small sample.},

@inproceedings{zhouAnomalyDetectionRobust2017,
 abstract = {Deep autoencoders, and other deep neural networks, have demonstrated their e ectiveness in discovering non-linear features across many problem domains. However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders' ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, X = LD + S, where LD can be e ectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and S contains the outliers and noise in the original data X . Since such spli ing increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a ``Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)''. Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such ``Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)'' give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.},

@article{zhouFaultFormerPretrainingTransformers2024,
 abstract = {The growth of global consumption has motivated important applications of deep learning to smart manufacturing and machine health monitoring. In particular, analyzing vibration data offers great potential to extract meaningful insights into predictive maintenance by the detection of bearing faults. Deep learning can be a powerful method to predict these mechanical failures; however, they lack generalizability to new tasks or datasets and require expensive, labeled mechanical data. We address this by presenting a novel self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning framework based on transformer models. In particular, we investigate different tokenization and data augmentation strategies to reach state-of-the-art accuracies using transformer models. Furthermore, we demonstrate self-supervised masked pretraining for vibration signals and its application to low-data regimes, task adaptation, and dataset adaptation. Pretraining is able to improve performance on scarce, unseen training samples, as well as when fine-tuning on fault classes outside of the pretraining distribution. Furthermore, pretrained transformers are shown to be able to generalize to a different dataset in a few-shot manner. This introduces a new paradigm where models can be pretrained on unlabeled data from different bearings, faults, and machinery and quickly deployed to new, data-scarce applications to suit specific manufacturing needs.},

@article{zhuDesignModelFusion2025,
 abstract = {This paper proposes an end-to-end model fusion feature learning method based on deep bidirectional gated recurrent unit (MCNN-DBiGRU) for fault diagnosis in industrial processes. First, a feature-aligned multi-scale feature extraction model (MCNN) is designed by analyzing the working principles of convolutional and pooling layers of convolutional neural networks. Secondly, a deep bidirectional mechanism is proposed to better extract the time series features in the process data. This mechanism makes the recurrent neural network not only present the forward processing input features from the past to the future, but also the reverse processing from the future to the past. By integrating these features, the diagnostic performance of the network model is improved. To verify that the proposed model has effective diagnostic accuracy for fault diagnosis, we conduct simulation experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process and a chemical coking furnace, and compare with several conventional network models. In the end, not only the effectiveness of the model is proved, but it is also confirmed that the model is superior to other conventional neural networks in both diagnostic accuracy and feature robustness.},

@article{zhuNewIncrementalLearning2024,
 abstract = {Deep learning has been widely used for fault diagnosis of complex mechanical equipment in recent years. However, fault types keep increasing with the change in the working state of mechanical equipment in practical scenarios, which causes the performance of traditional machine-learning models to degrade rapidly. Incremental learning can continuously learn new knowledge from incremental information while retaining previously learned knowledge, effectively enhancing the generalization performance of the model to meet the needs of fault diagnosis in actual industrial scenarios. Moreover, the noise environment will have a certain effect on the performance of the model. Therefore, this article proposes a new incremental learning method using classification and feature-level information, which aims to improve the robustness of the model under noisy conditions. First, an adaptive dual-branch residual network is constructed, and weights are assigned through an adaptive algorithm to enable the model to retain old knowledge while learning new knowledge. Then, an adversarial network is used to reduce the differences at the feature level after the samples pass through the model of different phases, which ensures the sustainable learning ability of the model and promotes knowledge transfer between different phases. Meanwhile, catastrophic forgetting is overcome through knowledge distillation loss. The comparative experimental results show that the proposed method in this article outperforms the current popular incremental learning method.},
