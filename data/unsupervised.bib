  abstract = {The rapid growth in the industrial sector has required the development of more productive and reliable machinery, and therefore, leads to complex systems. In this regard, the automatic detection of unknown events in machinery represents a greater challenge, since uncharacterized catastrophic faults can occur. However, the existing methods for anomaly detection present limitations when dealing with highly complex industrial systems. For that purpose, a novel fault diagnosis methodology is developed to face the anomaly detection. An unsupervised anomaly detection framework named deep-autoencoder-compact-clustering one-class support-vector machine (DAECC-OC-SVM) is presented, which aims to incorporate the advantages of automatically learnt representation by deep neural network to improved anomaly detection performance. The method combines the training of a deep-autoencoder with clustering compact model and a one-class supportvector-machine function-based outlier detection method. The addressed methodology is applied on a public rolling bearing faults experimental test bench and on multi-fault experimental test bench. The results show that the proposed methodology it is able to accurately to detect unknown defects, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Anomalies are infrequent in nature, but detecting these anomalies could be crucial for the proper functioning of any system. The rarity of anomalies could be a challenge for their detection as detection models are required to depend on the relations of the datapoints with their adjacent datapoints. In this work, we use the rarity of anomalies to detect them. For this, we introduce the reversible instance normalized anomaly transformer (RINAT). Rooted in the foundational principles of the anomaly transformer, RINAT incorporates both prior and series associations for each time point. The prior association uses a learnable Gaussian kernel to ensure a thorough understanding of the adjacent concentration inductive bias. In contrast, the series association method uses self-attention techniques to specifically focus on the original raw data. Furthermore, because anomalies are rare in nature, we utilize normalized data to identify series associations and employ non-normalized data to uncover prior associations. This approach enhances the modelled series associations and, consequently, improves the association discrepancies.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, most deep-learning-based bearing fault diagnosis methods are studied under the condition of steady speed, while the performance of these models cannot be fully played under time-varying conditions. Therefore, in order to facilitate the practical application of a deep learning model in bearing fault diagnosis, a vibration--speed fusion network is proposed, which utilizes a transformer with a self-attention module to extract vibration features and utilizes a sparse autoencoder (SAE) network to extract sparse features from speed pulse signal. The vibration--speed fusion network enables the efficient fusion of different signals in a high-dimensional vector space with a high degree of model interpretability, without additional signal processing steps. After tuning the hyperparameters of the network, the key segments of the bearing's time-domain vibration signals can be optimally extracted, the network performance is much better than traditional deep learning methods, and the classification accuracy can reach 95.18\% and 99.85\% on the two public bearing datasets from the Xi'an Jiaotong University and the University of Ottawa.},

  abstract = {Enthusiasm for ship autonomy is flourishing in the maritime industry. In this context, data-driven prognostics and health management (PHM) systems have emerged as the optimal way to improve operational reliability and system safety. However, further research is needed to enhance the essential actions relating to such a system. Fault detection is the first and most crucial action of any data-driven PHM system. In this article, we propose a fault-type independent spectral anomaly detection algorithm for marine diesel engine degradation in autonomous ferries. The benefits of the algorithm are verified on three fault types where the nature of degradation differs. Both normal operation data and faulty degradation data have been collected from a marine diesel engine using two different engine load profiles. These profiles aim to replicate real autonomous ferry crossing operations, environmental conditions that the ferry may encounter. First, the data are subjected to a feature selection process to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Then, a multiregime normalization method is performed on the data to merge the engine loads into one context. Finally, a variational autoencoder is trained to estimate velocity and acceleration calculations of the anomaly score. Generic and dynamic threshold limits are simultaneously established to detect the fault time step online. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 97.66\% in the final test when the acceleration was used as the fault detector. The results suggest that the algorithm is independent of fault types with different nature of degradation related to the marine diesel engine.},

  abstract = {Several techniques for multivariate time series anomaly detection have been proposed recently, but a systematic comparison on a common set of datasets and metrics is lacking. This article presents a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of unsupervised and semisupervised deep-learning-based methods for anomaly detection and diagnosis on multivariate time series data from cyberphysical systems. Unlike previous works, we vary the model and post-processing of model errors, i.e., the scoring functions independently of each other, through a grid of ten models and four scoring functions, comparing these variants to state-of-the-art methods. In time-series anomaly detection, detecting anomalous events is more important than detecting individual anomalous time points. Through experiments, we find that the existing evaluation metrics either do not take events into account or cannot distinguish between a good detector and trivial detectors, such as a random or an all-positive detector. We propose a new metric to overcome these drawbacks, namely, the composite F-score (Fc1), for evaluating time-series anomaly detection. Our study highlights that dynamic scoring functions work much better than static ones for multivariate time series anomaly detection, and the choice of scoring functions often matters more than the choice of the underlying model. We also find that a simple, channel-wise model---the univariate fully connected auto-encoder, with the dynamic Gaussian scoring function emerges as a winning candidate for both anomaly detection and diagnosis, beating state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Based on the limited sample data, the principle of the approach is to detect whether a test dataset contains abnormal patterns by using data distribution as the metric. The sequence obeying unexpected distribution will be identified as collective anomaly, which may be generated by fault patterns. The approach consists of three steps. First, the mixture of multivariate Gaussian distribution is used to fit the structure of sample dataset and test dataset. Then, based on maximum likelihood estimate algorithm, we hope to search the optimal parameters which can fit the data distribution with the highest degree. Finally, the fixed point iteration algorithm is used to solve likelihood estimate functions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can be used to find fault patterns of gearbox without the prior knowledge of their generated mechanisms.},

We provide a fault anomaly detection technique based on distillation learning to address this issue. Two Vision Transformer (ViT) models are specif\- ically used in the distillation learning process, one of which serves as the teacher network and the other as the student network. By using a small-scale student network model, the computational efficiency of the model is increased without sacrificing model accuracy. For feature-centered representation, new loss and anomaly score functions are created, and an enhanced Transformer encoder with the residual block is proposed. Then, a rolling bearing dynamics simulation method is used to obtain rich fault sample data, and the pre-training of the teacher network is completed. For anomaly detection, the training of the student network is completed based on the proposed loss function and the pre-trained teacher network, using only the vibration acceleration samples ob\- tained from the normal state. Finally, the trained completed network and the designed anomaly score function are used to achieve the anomaly detection of rolling bearing faults. The experimental validation was carried out on two sets of test data and one set of real vibration data of a whole aero-engine, and the detection accuracy reached 100 \%. The results show that the proposed method has a high capability of rolling bearing fault anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a semi-supervised autoencoder with an auxiliary task (SAAT) to extract a health feature space for power transformer fault diagnosis using dissolved gas analysis (DGA). The health feature space generated by a semi-supervised autoencoder (SSAE) not only identifies normal and thermal/electrical fault types, but also presents the underlying characteristics of DGA. In the proposed approach, by adding an auxiliary task that detects normal and fault states in the loss function of SSAE, the health feature space additionally enables visualization of health degradation properties. The overall procedure of the new approach includes three key steps: 1) preprocessing DGA data, 2) extracting two health features via SAAT, and 3) visualizing the two health features in two-dimensional space. In this paper, we test the proposed approach using massive unlabeled/labeled Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) databases and IEC TC 10 databases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four comparative studies are conducted with these datasets; the studies examined: 1) the effectiveness of an auxiliary detection task, 2) the effectiveness of the visualization method, 3) conventional fault diagnosis methods, and 4) the state-of-the-art, semi-supervised deep learning algorithms. By examining several evaluation metrics, these comparative studies confirm that the proposed approach outperforms SSAE without the auxiliary task, existing methods, and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, in terms of defining health degradation performance. We expect that the proposed SAAT-based health feature space approach will be widely applicable to intuitively monitor the health state of power transformers in the real world.},

Furthermore, data collected by the edge device may contain the user's private data, which is challenging the current detection approaches as user privacy is calling for the public concern in recent years. With this focus, this paper proposes a new communication-efficient ondevice federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly detection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Specifically, we first introduce a FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its generalization ability. Second, we propose an Attention Mechanism-based Convolutional Neural NetworkLong Short Term Memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention mechanism-based CNN units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby preventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this model retains the advantages of LSTM unit in predicting time series data. Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top-k selection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experiment studies on four real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately and timely detect anomalies and also reduce the communication overhead by 50\% compared to the federated learning framework that does not use gradient compression scheme.},

More concretely, we utilize data augmentation techniques that incorporate geometric distribution masks to expand our training data, thereby enhancing its diversity. Then, a Transformer-based Autoencoder is trained within a Generative Adversarial Network framework to capture the underlying distribution for normal points. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive loss into our discriminator to effectively regulate the GAN and ensure good generalization. Finally, anomalies are detected based on reconstruction errors. Numerous experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrated that our proposed method can effectively mitigates overfitting issues and obtains superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, our model could achieve an average improvement of 9.28\% in Precision, 11.33\% in Recall, and 11.73\% in F1-score.},

  abstract = {Detecting anomalies, such as defects in newly manufactured products or damage in long-used material structures, is a tedious task for humans. Given the current advances in the areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision, automation of visual quality control is possible and can be a reliable solution. Current methods that achieve state-of-the-art anomaly detection results often use features of different scales extracted from pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN). We propose employing multiple feature sets of the same scale alongside a normalizing flow model designed specifically for such sets. Such input features allow the creation of significantly smaller flow models with faster inference. We managed to achieve a decrease of up to 77.5\% in the number of flow model parameters and 63.6\% in inference time while still accomplishing results better than all other flow models and all but one non-flow method. Experimental evaluation on publicly available MVTec AD and MTD datasets showed a state-of-the-art level of performance of our models, thus proving that it is not necessary to use different scales to detect anomalies of different sizes. This research paves the way for real-time, efficient AI-based automation of visual inspection.},

  abstract = {Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been extensively deployed to monitor environments. Sensor nodes are susceptible to fault generation due to hardware and software failures in harsh environments. Anomaly detection for the time-series streaming data of sensor nodes is a challenging but critical fault diagnosis task, particularly in large-scale WSNs. The data-driven approach is becoming essential for the goal of improving the reliability and stability of WSNs. We propose a data-driven anomaly detection approach in this paper, named median filter (MF)-stacked long short-term memory-exponentially weighted moving average (LSTM-EWMA), for time-series status data, including the operating voltage and panel temperature recorded by a sensor node deployed in the field. These status data can be used to diagnose device anomalies. First, a median filter (MF) is introduced as a preprocessor to preprocess obvious anomalies in input data. Then, stacked long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed for prediction. Finally, the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart is employed as a detector for recognizing anomalies. We evaluate the proposed approach for the panel temperature and operating voltage of time-series streaming data recorded by wireless node devices deployed in harsh field conditions for environmental monitoring. Extensive experiments were conducted on real time-series status data. The results demonstrate that compared to other approaches, the MF-stacked LSTM-EWMA approach can significantly improve the detection rate (DR) and false rate (FR). The average DR and FR values with the proposed approach are 95.46\% and 4.42\%, respectively. MF-stacked LSTM-EWMA anomaly detection also achieves a better F2 score than that achieved by other methods. The proposed approach provides valuable insights for anomaly detection in WSNs by detecting anomalies in the time-series status data recorded by wireless sensor nodes.},

  abstract = {The need for robust unsupervised anomaly detection in streaming data is increasing rapidly in the current era of smart devices, where enormous data are gathered from numerous sensors. These sensors record the internal state of a machine, the external environment, and the interaction of machines with other machines and humans. It is of prime importance to leverage this information in order to minimize downtime of machines, or even avoid downtime completely by constant monitoring. Since each device generates a different type of streaming data, it is normally the case that a specific kind of anomaly detection technique performs better than the others depending on the data type. For some types of data and use-cases, statistical anomaly detection techniques work better, whereas for others, deep learning-based techniques are preferred. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection technique, FuseAD, which takes advantage of both statistical and deep-learning-based approaches by fusing them together in a residual fashion. The obtained results show an increase in area under the curve (AUC) as compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when FuseAD is tested on a publicly available dataset (Yahoo Webscope benchmark). The obtained results advocate that this fusion-based technique can obtain the best of both worlds by combining their strengths and complementing their weaknesses. We also perform an ablation study to quantify the contribution of the individual components in FuseAD, i.e., the statistical ARIMA model as well as the deep-learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) model.},

It employs an attention-based mechanism, akin to the deep transformer model, with key architectural modifications for predicting the next time step window in the autoencoder's latent space. The model utilizes a threshold from the validation dataset for anomaly detection and introduces an alternative method based on analyzing the first statistical moment of error, improving accuracy without dependence on a validation dataset.

  abstract = {In light of the remarkable advancements made in time-series anomaly detection (TSAD), recent emphasis has been placed on exploiting the frequency domain as well as the time domain to address the difficulties in precisely detecting pattern-wise anomalies. However, in terms of anomaly scores, the window granularity of the frequency domain is inherently distinct from the data-point granularity of the time domain. Owing to this discrepancy, the anomaly information in the frequency domain has not been utilized to its full potential for TSAD. In this paper, we propose a TSAD framework, Dual-TF , that simultaneously uses both the time and frequency domains while breaking the time-frequency granularity discrepancy. To this end, our framework employs nested-sliding windows, with the outer and inner windows responsible for the time and frequency domains, respectively, and aligns the anomaly scores of the two domains. As a result of the high resolution of the aligned scores, the boundaries of pattern-wise anomalies can be identified more precisely. In six benchmark datasets, our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 12.0--147\%, as demonstrated by experimental results.},

  abstract = {A modern vehicle fitted with sensors, actuators, and Electronic Control Units (ECUs) can be divided into several operational subsystems called Functional Working Groups (FWGs). Examples of these FWGs include the engine system, transmission, fuel system, brakes, etc. Each FWG has associated sensorchannels that gauge vehicular operating conditions. This data rich environment is conducive to the development of Predictive Maintenance (PdM) technologies. Undercutting various PdM technologies is the need for robust anomaly detection models that can identify events or observations which deviate significantly from the majority of the data and do not conform to a well defined notion of normal vehicular operational behavior. In this paper, we introduce the Vehicle Performance, Reliability, and Operations (VePRO) dataset and use it to create a multi-phased approach to anomaly detection. Utilizing Temporal Convolution Networks (TCN), our anomaly detection system can achieve 96\% detection accuracy and accurately predicts 91\% of true anomalies. The performance of our anomaly detection system improves when sensor channels from multiple FWGs are utilized.},

  abstract = {Google uses continuous streams of data from industry partners in order to deliver accurate results to users. Unexpected drops in traffic can be an indication of an underlying issue and may be an early warning that remedial action may be necessary. Detecting such drops is non-trivial because streams are variable and noisy, with roughly regular spikes (in many different shapes) in traffic data. We investigated the question of whether or not we can predict anomalies in these data streams. Our goal is to utilize Machine Learning and statistical approaches to classify anomalous drops in periodic, but noisy, traffic patterns. Since we do not have a large body of labeled examples to directly apply supervised learning for anomaly classification, we approached the problem in two parts. First we used TensorFlow to train our various models including DNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs to perform regression and predict the expected value in the time series. Secondly we created anomaly detection rules that compared the actual values to predicted values. Since the problem requires finding sustained anomalies, rather than just short delays or momentary inactivity in the data, our two detection methods focused on continuous sections of activity rather than just single points. We tried multiple combinations of our models and rules and found that using the intersection of our two anomaly detection methods proved to be an effective method of detecting anomalies on almost all of our models. In the process we also found that not all data fell within our experimental assumptions, as one data stream had no periodicity, and therefore no time based model could predict it.},

  abstract = {Fault diagnosis is very important to the modern manufacturing system. As a powerful data-driven method, machine learning (ML) has been widely used for fault diagnosis. However, a certain amount of labelled data is essential to most of the ML methods, which is not always available. In this study, an unsupervised fault diagnosis method based on iterative multi-manifold spectral clustering (IMMSC) is proposed. The IMMSC, that the affinity matrix is constructed based on local tangent space, can improve the performance of spectral clustering on multi-manifold distributed data. The IMMSC is conducted after feature extraction to divide data into different clusters first. Then local outlier factor is utilised to identify the normal condition. A fault index is found to recognise the fault conditions. The proposed IMMSC is tested on five simulation datasets and the proposed method is validated on the motor bearing dataset provided by Case Western Reserve University. The mean accuracy of IMMSC on simulation data is 97.85\%, which outperforms the other spectral clustering and traditional methods. Furthermore, the result of the IMMSC is stable over 30 individual tests. The mean accuracy of the proposed method on motor bearing dataset is 98.53\%. The result demonstrates its potential in fault diagnosis field.},

Particularly for anomaly detection in time series, it is essential to learn the underlying structure of a system's normal behavior.

In this paper, we present TCN-AE, a temporal convolutional network autoencoder based on dilated convolutions. Contrary to many other anomaly detection algorithms, TCN-AE is trained in an unsupervised manner. The algorithm demonstrates its efficacy on a comprehensive real-world anomaly benchmark comprising electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of patients with cardiac arrhythmia.

  abstract = {Efficient anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate timeseries data is of great importance for modern industrial applications. However, building a system that is able to quickly and accurately pinpoint anomalous observations is a challenging problem. This is due to the lack of anomaly labels, high data volatility and the demands of ultra-low inference times in modern applications. Despite the recent developments of deep learning approaches for anomaly detection, only a few of them can address all of these challenges. In this paper, we propose TranAD, a deep transformer network based anomaly detection and diagnosis model which uses attentionbased sequence encoders to swiftly perform inference with the knowledge of the broader temporal trends in the data. TranAD uses focus score-based self-conditioning to enable robust multi-modal feature extraction and adversarial training to gain stability. Additionally, model-agnostic meta learning (MAML) allows us to train the model using limited data. Extensive empirical studies on six publicly available datasets demonstrate that TranAD can outperform state-of-the-art baseline methods in detection and diagnosis performance with data and time-efficient training. Specifically, TranAD increases F1 scores by up to 17\%, reducing training times by up to 99\% compared to the baselines.},

The representation and reconstruction of time series have made extraordinary progress in existing works. However, time series is known to be complex in terms of their temporal dependency and stochasticity, which makes anomaly detection difficult. To this end, we propose a novel approach based on a decomposition auto-transformer networks(DATN) for time series anomaly detection. The time series is decomposed into seasonal and trend components, and renovated as a basic inner block deep model. With this design, transformers can decompose complex time series in a progressive manner. We also design an auto-transfomer block that determines dependencies and representation aggregation at the sub-series level based on series seasonal and trend components. Moreover, the complex transformer decoder is replaced by a simple linear decoder, which makes the model more efficient. Extensive experiments on various public benchmarks demonstrate that our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract = {Unsupervised detection of anomaly points in time series is a challenging problem, which requires the model to derive a distinguishable criterion. Previous methods tackle the problem mainly through learning pointwise representation or pairwise association, however, neither is sufficient to reason about the intricate dynamics. Recently, Transformers have shown great power in unified modeling of pointwise representation and pairwise association, and we find that the self-attention weight distribution of each time point can embody rich association with the whole series. Our key observation is that due to the rarity of anomalies, it is extremely difficult to build nontrivial associations from abnormal points to the whole series, thereby, the anomalies' associations shall mainly concentrate on their adjacent time points. This adjacent-concentration bias implies an association-based criterion inherently distinguishable between normal and abnormal points, which we highlight through the Association Discrepancy. Technically, we propose the Anomaly Transformer with a new Anomaly-Attention mechanism to compute the association discrepancy. A minimax strategy is devised to amplify the normal-abnormal distinguishability of the association discrepancy. The Anomaly Transformer achieves state-of-theart results on six unsupervised time series anomaly detection benchmarks of three applications: service monitoring, space \& earth exploration, and water treatment.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection in multivariate time series has emerged as a crucial challenge in time series research, with significant research implications in various fields such as fraud detection, fault diagnosis, and system state estimation. Reconstruction-based models have shown promising potential in recent years for detecting anomalies in time series data. However, due to the rapid increase in data scale and dimensionality, the issues of noise and Weak Identity Mapping (WIM) during time series reconstruction have become increasingly pronounced. To address this, we introduce a novel Adaptive Dynamic Neighbor Mask (ADNM) mechanism and integrate it with the Transformer and Denoising Diffusion Model, creating a new framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection, named Denoising Diffusion Mask Transformer (DDMT). The ADNM module is introduced to mitigate information leakage between input and output features during data reconstruction, thereby alleviating the problem of WIM during reconstruction. The Denoising Diffusion Transformer (DDT) employs the Transformer as an internal neural network structure for Denoising Diffusion Model. It learns the stepwise generation process of time series data to model the probability distribution of the data, capturing normal data patterns and progressively restoring time series data by removing noise, resulting in a clear recovery of anomalies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model that combines Denoising Diffusion Model and the Transformer for multivariate time series anomaly detection. Experimental evaluations were conducted on five publicly available multivariate time series anomaly detection datasets. The results demonstrate that the model effectively identifies anomalies in time series data, achieving state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods are promising tools for machinery fault diagnosis in modern industry. However, the diagnostic performance of these methods will deteriorate significantly with insufficient labeled data or varying working condition. To address this problem, a self-supervised learning (SSL) method with self-attention mechanism is proposed for machinery fault diagnosis under limited labeled data and nonstationary working condition. A simple but effective pretext task is first constructed to take full advantage of unlabeled data under varying working condition. By completing the pretext task, a pretrained model is generated for effective feature representation with the constraint of signal masking and reconstruction, thus enhancing the capability of extracting discriminative features. Then, a fine-tuned model, which inherits the capability of feature extraction of pretrained one by knowledge transfer, is built by feeding into few labeled samples. Moreover, with our SSL method, transformer architecture with self-attention mechanism is used as the backbone to enhance the ability of modeling global dependency and extracting temporal information. The experimental results reveal that our method can achieve better diagnostic performance under new working condition by comparing with six advanced methods. Furthermore, a discussion on the capability of reconstruction and the classification effect is performed in this study, which demonstrates the rationality of our designed pretext task.},

  abstract = {Applying deep learning to unsupervised bearing fault diagnosis in complex industrial environments is challenging. Traditional fault detection methods rely on labeled data, which is costly and labor-intensive to obtain. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised approach, WDCAE-LKA, combining a wide kernel convolutional autoencoder (WDCAE) with a large kernel attention (LKA) mechanism to improve fault detection under unlabeled conditions, and the adaptive threshold module based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) dynamically adjusts thresholds, boosting model robustness in imbalanced scenarios. Experimental validation on two datasets (CWRU and a customized ball screw dataset) demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms both traditional and state-of-theart methods. Notably, WDCAE-LKA achieved an average diagnostic accuracy of 90.29\% in varying fault scenarios on the CWRU dataset and 72.89\% in the customized ball screw dataset and showed remarkable robustness under imbalanced conditions; compared with advanced models, it shortens training time by 10--26\% and improves average fault diagnosis accuracy by 5--10\%. The results underscore the potential of the WDCAE-LKA model as a robust and effective solution for intelligent fault diagnosis in industrial applications.},

  abstract = {For PHM(Predictive Health Management) in an industrial scenario, motor vibration anomaly detection requires a large number of labeled data. The problem is that the anomaly vibration signal data is scarce and difficult to be obtained, especially the problem of insufficient data in the building and deployment of multi-machine models. This paper proposes a Meta-learning method based on deep unsupervised learning(Autoencoder). We use non-labeled and a small amount of vibration signal data which is converted into 52 key physical and statistical features to build models of different motors. By inputting these 52 features into designed models, other 52 features can be reconstructed as output. We use input and output features to calculate reconstruction error which is used as the criterion for the performance of models. We also use accuracy as the criterion for the performance of models. In the actual industrial situation, the improvement of accuracy by our proposed method is about 33.50\% better than the method only with unsupervised learning for the new sensor model with few vibration data.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, multivariate time series data are increasingly collected in various real world systems, e.g., power plants, wearable devices, etc. Anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series refer to identifying abnormal status in certain time steps and pinpointing the root causes. Building such a system, however, is challenging since it not only requires to capture the temporal dependency in each time series, but also need encode the inter-correlations between different pairs of time series. In addition, the system should be robust to noise and provide operators with different levels of anomaly scores based upon the severity of different incidents.

In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Convolutional Recurrent Encoder-Decoder (MSCRED), to perform anomaly detection and diagnosis in multivariate time series data. Specifically, MSCRED first constructs multi-scale (resolution) signature matrices to characterize multiple levels of the system statuses in different time steps. Subsequently, given the signature matrices, a convolutional encoder is employed to encode the inter-sensor (time series) correlations and an attention based Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) network is developed to capture the temporal patterns. Finally, based upon the feature maps which encode the inter-sensor correlations and temporal information, a convolutional decoder is used to reconstruct the input signature matrices and the residual signature matrices are further utilized to detect and diagnose anomalies.

  abstract = {Deep autoencoders, and other deep neural networks, have demonstrated their e ectiveness in discovering non-linear features across many problem domains. However, in many real-world problems, large outliers and pervasive noise are commonplace, and one may not have access to clean training data as required by standard deep denoising autoencoders. Herein, we demonstrate novel extensions to deep autoencoders which not only maintain a deep autoencoders' ability to discover high quality, non-linear features but can also eliminate outliers and noise without access to any clean training data. Our model is inspired by Robust Principal Component Analysis, and we split the input data X into two parts, X = LD + S, where LD can be e ectively reconstructed by a deep autoencoder and S contains the outliers and noise in the original data X . Since such spli ing increases the robustness of standard deep autoencoders, we name our model a ``Robust Deep Autoencoder (RDA)''. Further, we present generalizations of our results to grouped sparsity norms which allow one to distinguish random anomalies from other types of structured corruptions, such as a collection of features being corrupted across many instances or a collection of instances having more corruptions than their fellows. Such ``Group Robust Deep Autoencoders (GRDA)'' give rise to novel anomaly detection approaches whose superior performance we demonstrate on a selection of benchmark problems.},
