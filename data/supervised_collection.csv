However, a separate fault diagnosis method or anomaly detection method cannot identify unknown faults and distinguish between different fault types simultaneously; thus, it is difﬁcult to meet the increasing demand for safety and reliability of industrial systems. Besides, the actual system often operates in varying working conditions and is disturbed by the noise, which results in the intraclass variance of the raw data and degrades the performance of industrial system monitoring. To solve these problems, a metric learning-based fault diagnosis and anomaly detection method is proposed. Fault diagnosis and anomaly detection are adaptively fused in the proposed endto-end model, where anomaly detection can prevent the model from misjudging the unknown anomaly as the known type, while fault diagnosis can identify the speciﬁc type of system fault. In addition, a novel multicenter loss is introduced to restrain the intraclass variance. Compared with manual feature extraction that can only extract suboptimal features, it can learn discriminant features automatically for both fault diagnosis and anomaly detection tasks. Experiments on three-phase ﬂow (TPF) facility and Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) bearing have demonstrated that the proposed method can avoid the interference of intraclass variances and learn features that are effective for identifying tasks. Moreover, it achieves the best performance in both fault diagnosis and anomaly detection.","2024-01","2024-03-08 16:31:22","2025-06-01 11:19:54","2024-03-08 16:31:22","547-558","","1","35","","IEEE Trans.

The standard approach toward this challenge is based on vibration monitoring, which requires the installation of speciﬁc tailored sensors that incur associated added costs. On the other hand, the life expectancy of wind parks built during the 1990s wind power boom is dwindling, and data-driven maintenance strategies issued from already accessible supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) data is an auspicious competitive solution because no additional sensors are required. Note that it is a major issue to provide fault diagnosis approaches built only on SCADA data, as these data were not established with the objective of being used for condition monitoring but rather for control capacities. The present study posits an early fault diagnosis strategy based exclusively on SCADA data and supports it with results on a real wind park with 18 wind turbines. The contributed methodology is an anomaly detection model based on a one-class support vector machine classiﬁer; that is, it is a semi-supervised approach that trains a decision function that categorizes fresh data as similar or dissimilar to the training set. Therefore, only healthy (normal operation) data is required to train the model, which greatly expands the possibility of employing this methodology (because there is no need for faulty data from the past, and only normal operation SCADA data is needed). The results obtained from the real wind park show that this is a promising strategy.","2022-06-16","2024-03-06 13:05:52","2025-06-01 10:27:47","2024-03-06 13:05:52","4381","","12","15","","Energies","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Uses SVM and threshold of utrain + sigmatrain</p> </div>","; /Users/Adri/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-adria.molero@upc.edu/Mi unidad/Zotero/storage/BLAW9KRQ/Tutivén et al. - 2022 - Early Fault Diagnosis Strategy for WT Main Bearing.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Tutiv-n-et-al-2022-9bc8c397811d40ff825381f784e9efee","Anomaly detection; Computer Science - Machine Learning; notion; SCADA data; SVM; Wind turbine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, one of the most challenging tasks for the machinery fault diagnosis is to incrementally classify unknown abnormal patterns. For this reason, an incremental novelty identiﬁcation (INI) method is proposed, on the strength of deep learningbased representation learning, novelty detection and incremental learning. In the INI framework, a convolutional neural network autoencoder is ﬁrst developed for high-level feature extraction from multiple monitoring signals. An online sequential-extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) is then proposed to learn healthy features of the normal condition initially known. The newly collected data are employed for updating the OS-ELM with the quantiﬁcation of the model modiﬁcation for novelty detection. An incremental learning procedure is implemented by adding a new OS-ELM model representing the novel abnormal pattern. The repository of OS-ELMs, each of which represents a speciﬁc condition, is employed for incrementally diagnosing known abnormal patterns with the identiﬁcation of unknown ones. The performance of the proposed INI is validated under experimental scenarios considering both a benchmark bearing case study and a delta three-dimensional printer, and the results are compared with other state-of-the-art approaches.","2022-07","2024-03-06 13:06:00","2025-06-01 11:02:14","2024-03-06 13:06:00","7394-7404","","7","69","","IEEE Trans.

Faulty data samples are usually more difficult for collection than normal operation data. Existing works show that the generative adversarial networks (GAN) are useful generating synthetic faulty data samples to enrich the training dataset. However, it remains a problem for the automated FDD applications to select high-quality synthetic faulty samples generated by GAN. The FDD accuracy becomes unstable when the quality of synthetic fault data samples cannot be controlled entirely. In this study, we proposed to use the classic definition of anomaly detection to select high-quality synthetic fault data samples with the generative adversarial networks. Two anomaly detection methods were investigated, including the traditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the GANomaly. Through a series of experiments, it is justified that, with a small amount of real fault data, the proposed GANbased chiller FDD framework with GANomaly achieves the highest FDD accuracy than all compared methods.","2021-08","2024-03-06 13:05:01","2025-05-30 14:16:31","2024-03-06 13:05:01","107982","","","201","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>Uses GAN and VAE to generate synthetic fault data.

In this study, a data mining approach using a machine learning technique called anomaly detection (AD) is presented. This method employs classiﬁcation techniques to discriminate between defect examples. Two features, kurtosis and Non-Gaussianity Score (NGS), are extracted to develop anomaly detection algorithms. The performance of the developed algorithms was examined through real data from a test to failure bearing.

Because of the unique properties of mechanical data, predetermined features based on prior knowledge are usually used as inputs for fault classiﬁcation. However, proper selection of features often requires expertise knowledge and becomes more difﬁcult and time consuming when volume of data increases. In this paper, a novel deep learning network (LiftingNet) is proposed to learn features adaptively from raw mechanical data without prior knowledge. Inspired by convolutional neural network and second generation wavelet transform, the LiftingNet is constructed to classify mechanical data even though inputs contain considerable noise and randomness. The LiftingNet consists of split layer, predict layer, update layer, pooling layer, and fullconnection layer. Different kernel sizes are allowed in convolutional layers to improve learning ability. As a multilayer neural network, deep features are learned from shallow ones to represent complex structures in raw data. Feasibility and effectiveness of the LiftingNet is validated by two motor bearing datasets.

The health feature space generated by a semi-supervised autoencoder (SSAE) not only identiﬁes normal and thermal/electrical fault types, but also presents the underlying characteristics of DGA. In the proposed approach, by adding an auxiliary task that detects normal and fault states in the loss function of SSAE, the health feature space additionally enables visualization of health degradation properties. The overall procedure of the new approach includes three key steps: 1) preprocessing DGA data, 2) extracting two health features via SAAT, and 3) visualizing the two health features in two-dimensional space. In this paper, we test the proposed approach using massive unlabeled/labeled Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) databases and IEC TC 10 databases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four comparative studies are conducted with these datasets; the studies examined: 1) the effectiveness of an auxiliary detection task, 2) the effectiveness of the visualization method, 3) conventional fault diagnosis methods, and 4) the state-of-the-art, semi-supervised deep learning algorithms. By examining several evaluation metrics, these comparative studies conﬁrm that the proposed approach outperforms SSAE without the auxiliary task, existing methods, and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, in terms of deﬁning health degradation performance.

Firstly, transformer vibration signals are measured by using the data measurement subsystem, and they are sent to the remote server by using the data reception subsystem.

To address this problem, a self-supervised learning (SSL) method with self-attention mechanism is proposed for machinery fault diagnosis under limited labeled data and nonstationary working condition. A simple but effective pretext task is first constructed to take full advantage of unlabeled data under varying working condition. By completing the pretext task, a pretrained model is generated for effective feature representation with the constraint of signal masking and reconstruction, thus enhancing the capability of extracting discriminative features. Then, a fine-tuned model, which inherits the capability of feature extraction of pretrained one by knowledge transfer, is built by feeding into few labeled samples. Moreover, with our SSL method, transformer architecture with self-attention mechanism is used as the backbone to enhance the ability of modeling global dependency and extracting temporal information. The experimental results reveal that our method can achieve better diagnostic performance under new working condition by comparing with six advanced methods.

However, fault types keep increasing with the change in the working state of mechanical equipment in practical scenarios, which causes the performance of traditional machine-learning models to degrade rapidly. Incremental learning can continuously learn new knowledge from incremental information while retaining previously learned knowledge, effectively enhancing the generalization performance of the model to meet the needs of fault diagnosis in actual industrial scenarios. Moreover, the noise environment will have a certain effect on the performance of the model. Therefore, this article proposes a new incremental learning method using classification and feature-level information, which aims to improve the robustness of the model under noisy conditions. First, an adaptive dual-branch residual network is constructed, and weights are assigned through an adaptive algorithm to enable the model to retain old knowledge while learning new knowledge. Then, an adversarial network is used to reduce the differences at the feature level after the samples pass through the model of different phases, which ensures the sustainable learning ability of the model and promotes knowledge transfer between different phases. Meanwhile, catastrophic forgetting is overcome through knowledge distillation loss. The comparative experimental results show that the proposed method in this article outperforms the current popular incremental learning method.","2024","2024-03-20 16:05:32","2025-06-01 09:12:16","2024-03-20 16:05:32","1-14","","","73","","IEEE Trans.

Secondly, a comprehensive database is constructed, incorporating PV model data alongside monitored module temperature and solar irradiance for both healthy and faulty operation conditions. Lastly, fault classification utilizes features extracted from a combination consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU). The amalgamation of parallel and sequential processing enables the neural network to leverage the strengths of both convolutional and recurrent layers concurrently, facilitating effective fault detection and diagnosis. The results affirm the proposed technique’s efficacy in detecting and classifying various PV fault types, such as open circuits, short circuits, and partial shading. Furthermore, this work underscores the significance of dividing fault detection and diagnosis into two distinct steps rather than employing deep learning neural networks to determine fault types directly.","2024-01-24","2024-03-20 15:53:44","2025-06-01 10:44:10","2024-03-20 15:53:44","1012","","3","16","","Sustainability","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Fault classification on PV data using 1DCNN + Bi-RNN (bidirectional to capture past and 'future' data).

It is challenging to accurately label incipient or secondary fault signals in the presence of operational background noise, resulting in noisy labels. This study presents a bidirectional guidance method that enables deep networks to diagnose faults robustly with the ability to label noise tolerance. First, the proposed method uses discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to preprocess vibration signals before feeding them into the deep convolutional network. Second, a bidirectional loss (BL) function is proposed to significantly improve the robustness of the model in the case of noisy labels. Third, a fast cosine decay (FCD) strategy of the learning rate is designed to further boost the recognition performance of the model under severe noisy labels.

At present, an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on deep learning has been widely applied in mechanical areas due to its strong ability of feature extraction and accurate identiﬁcation. However, it often depends on enough training samples. Generally, the model performance depends on sufﬁcient training samples. However, the fault data are always insufﬁcient in practical engineering as the mechanical equipment often works under normal conditions, resulting in imbalanced data. Deep learning-based models trained directly with the imbalanced data will greatly reduce the diagnosis accuracy. In this paper, a diagnosis method is proposed to address the imbalanced data problem and enhance the diagnosis accuracy. Firstly, signals from multiple sensors are processed by the wavelet transform to enhance data features, which are then squeezed and fused through pooling and splicing operations. Subsequently, improved adversarial networks are constructed to generate new samples for data augmentation. Finally, an improved residual network is constructed by introducing the convolutional block attention module for enhancing the diagnosis performance. The experiments containing two different types of bearing datasets are adopted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in single-class and multi-class data imbalance cases. The results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality synthetic samples and improve the diagnosis accuracy presenting great potential in imbalanced fault diagnosis.","2023-02-24","2024-04-17 15:24:49","2025-06-01 16:35:11","2024-04-17 15:24:49","2542","","5","23","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Fault diagnosis method that first preprocesses with a CWT to move from time series to images, then fuses all sensors signals with avg pooling and then trains a GAN to solve imbalance issue and finally performs fault classification using a CNN with attention module.

To address the problem of poor fault classification accuracy of rotating equipment, this paper proposes a new solution to deploy a composite fault diagnosis model at the front end to achieve low power consumption, continuous automatic identification and monitoring of equipment faults. We creatively combined the idea of speech recognition to solve the problem that traditional feature extraction methods are insufficient in handling composite fault diagnosis when dealing with fault waveform files, and used Fbank speech feature extraction idea to extract fault features, thus simplifying the complex fault diagnosis problem into an image classification problem. The generated composite fault Fbank feature data set is significantly different in visual observation. Therefore, we further designed the LeNet-F network based on the LeNet network for composite fault diagnosis. The model was validated on the K210 development board to achieve an accuracy of 97.41% for hybrid fault classification at a model size of 2.4MB. This makes it possible to apply the deep learning method to the front end to directly complete the composite fault diagnosis.","2023-06","2024-04-17 15:23:45","2025-05-30 14:13:04","2024-04-17 15:23:45","572-581","","2","13","","IEEE J.

Their performance heavily relies on the quality of human-annotated labels. Due to perception limitations of annotators, industrial time series samples (such as vibration and voltage signals) are frequently mislabeled in several conditions, such as samples with frequency domain feature differences and samples on class borders. Hence, an annotated industrial dataset will inevitably contain noisy labels at a certain level, leading to overﬁtting and poor generalization of DNNs. In this work, we introduce an industrial noisy label semisupervised learning (INL-SSL) fault diagnosis approach, addressing the problem that a certain number of samples in an industrial dataset are mislabeled. The proposed INL-SSL architecture simultaneously trains two DNNs, which cross-train on each other to ﬁlter noisy label errors. In particular, a ﬁtted Gaussian mixture model divides time series samples of each DNN ﬂow into an unlabeled set with samples likely to be noisy and a labeled set with samples likely to be clean. Given the labeled and unlabeled data, we proposed a time series MixMatch semisupervised learning strategy to train the diagnostic model. Ablation study veriﬁes the beneﬁt of the proposed time series augmentation techniques for semisupervised training. Extensive experiments on a benchmark industrial dataset of rolling element bearings (REB) reveal that the INL-SSL outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. On another self-collected REB dataset, the proposed approach also exceeds other comparison methods under noise ratios from 20% to 90%, validating the model’s generalizability.","2023-06","2024-04-17 15:13:46","2025-06-01 11:13:39","2024-04-17 15:13:46","7724-7732","","6","19","","IEEE Trans.

These sensors record the internal state of a machine, the external environment, and the interaction of machines with other machines and humans. It is of prime importance to leverage this information in order to minimize downtime of machines, or even avoid downtime completely by constant monitoring. Since each device generates a different type of streaming data, it is normally the case that a speciﬁc kind of anomaly detection technique performs better than the others depending on the data type. For some types of data and use-cases, statistical anomaly detection techniques work better, whereas for others, deep learning-based techniques are preferred. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection technique, FuseAD, which takes advantage of both statistical and deep-learning-based approaches by fusing them together in a residual fashion. The obtained results show an increase in area under the curve (AUC) as compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when FuseAD is tested on a publicly available dataset (Yahoo Webscope benchmark). The obtained results advocate that this fusion-based technique can obtain the best of both worlds by combining their strengths and complementing their weaknesses.

The objective of this study is to construct a lightweight machine learning-based fault detection and diagnostic system within the limited energy resources, memory, and computation of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In this paper, a ContextAware Fault Diagnostic (CAFD) scheme is proposed based on an ensemble learning algorithm called Extra-Trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, a realistic WSN scenario composed of humidity and temperature sensor observations is replicated with extreme low-intensity faults. Six commonly occurring types of sensor fault are considered: drift, hard-over/bias, spike, erratic/precision degradation, stuck, and data-loss. The proposed CAFD scheme reveals the ability to accurately detect and diagnose low-intensity sensor faults in a timely manner.

However, target data may be inaccessible in the model training phase, resulting in the degradation or failure of the diagnosis model. Therefore, this paper introduces a new idea called cross-domain augmentation (CDA) to achieve diagnosis under unseen working conditions, which are frequently occurred in industrial scenarios. To realize this idea, an adversarial domainaugmented generalization (ADAG) method is proposed with domain augmentation via convex combination of data and feature-label pairs. Through adversarial training on multi-source domains and the augmented domain, ADAG enables learning generalized and augmented features, which are proximal representation in the unseen domain, facilitating the generalization ability of the model. Moreover, feature extractor and domain classifier are optimized as adversaries in model training to obtain domain-invariant features, while the fault classifier is trained to identify the features. Extensive experiment studies indicate that ADAG can successfully solve the crossdomain diagnosis problem under unseen working conditions.

Among these studies, the methods based on artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deﬁciencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a speciﬁc diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artiﬁcial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deﬁciencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deﬁciencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods.","2016-05","2024-06-28 16:33:09","2025-06-01 09:07:13","2024-06-28 16:33:09","303-315","","","72-73","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","Deep neural networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #1f1f1f; -webkit-text-stroke: #1f1f1f; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 12.00px; font-kerning: none;"">A bit old paper but good theory on how to apply NN (autoencoder arch) for fault diagnosis.

On one hand, TSViT model integrates a convolutional layer to segment vibration signals and capture local features. On the other hand, it employs a transformer encoder to learn long-term temporal information. The experimental results with other methods on two distinct datasets validate the effectiveness and generalizability of TSViT with a comparative analysis of its hyperparameters' impact on model performance, computational complexity, and overall parameter quantity.

However, ensuring product quality is critical to the success of the FDM manufacturing process because defects can occur owing to various factors. An effective diagnosis facilitates timely corrective measures, thus enhancing quality control significantly. Although vision-based deep learning diagnostic methods have shown encouraging results, they do not take the autocorrelation of defective pixels resulting from layer-by-layer accumulation into account. The existing models do not fully utilize spatiotemporal correlations, thus resulting in limited diagnostic accuracy under certain circumstances. Hence, a time-series vision Transformer is proposed for the drifting process parameters that considers the spatiotemporal characteristics of the acquired data. In this approach, raw layer-wise images are decomposed and integrated into image streams containing temporal and spatial information. A Transformer network with cross space-time attention is adopted to extract spatiotemporal features from constructed image streams. A laboratory experiment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of our model. The overall framework not only achieves higher accuracy of 90.8 %, but also demonstrates better generalizability for different parameter drifts compared with traditional and state-of-the-art algorithms.

Deep learning can be a powerful method to predict these mechanical failures; however, they lack generalizability to new tasks or datasets and require expensive, labeled mechanical data. We address this by presenting a novel self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning framework based on transformer models. In particular, we investigate different tokenization and data augmentation strategies to reach state-of-the-art accuracies using transformer models. Furthermore, we demonstrate self-supervised masked pretraining for vibration signals and its application to low-data regimes, task adaptation, and dataset adaptation. Pretraining is able to improve performance on scarce, unseen training samples, as well as when fine-tuning on fault classes outside of the pretraining distribution. Furthermore, pretrained transformers are shown to be able to generalize to a different dataset in a few-shot manner. This introduces a new paradigm where models can be pretrained on unlabeled data from different bearings, faults, and machinery and quickly deployed to new, data-scarce applications to suit specific manufacturing needs.","2024","2024-12-16 12:03:12","2025-05-30 14:08:42","2024-12-16 12:03:12","70719-70728","","","12","","IEEE Access","FaultFormer","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2312.02380 [cs]","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Great paper and similar to our task.

To optimize the structure of existing transformer-like methods and improve the diagnostic accuracy, we proposed a novel method based on the multiscale time-frequency sparse transformer (MTFST) in this paper. First, a novel tokenizer based on shot-time Fourier transform (STFT) is designed, which processes the 1D format raw signals into 2D format discrete time-frequency sequences in the embedding space. Second, a sparse self-attention mechanism is designed to eliminate the feature mapping defect in naive self-attention mechanism. Then, the novel encoder-decoder structure is presented, the multiple encoders are employed to extract the hidden feature of different time-frequency sequences obtained by STFT with different window widths, and the decoder is used to remap the deep information and connect to the classifier for discriminating fault types. The proposed method is tested in the XJTU-SY bearing dataset and self-made experiment rig dataset, and the following work is conducted. The influences of hyperparameters on diagnosis accuracy and number of parameters are analysed in detail. The weights of the attention mechanism (AM) are visualized and analysed to study the interpretability, which explains the partly working pattern of the network. In the comparison test with other existing CNN, RNN, and transformer models, the diagnosis accuracy of different methods is statistically analysed, feature vectors are presented via the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method, and the proposed MTFST obtains the best accuracy and feature distribution form.

In fact, the integration of multiple mechanical components, the consideration of multiple operating conditions, and the appearance of combined fault patterns due to eventual multi-fault scenarios lead to complex electromechanical systems requiring advanced monitoring strategies. In this regard, data fusion schemes supported with advanced deep learning technology represent a promising approach towards a big data paradigm using cloud-based software services.

However, the computation efficiency of GAN in addressing the data imbalance issue has not been investigated. Hence, this study proposes a lightweight GAN named compact con­ volutional Transformers-GAN (CCT-GAN) to alleviate the data imbalance issue in compound fault diagnosis modelling. Firstly, the feedback current signals collected from the industrial robot are transformed into timefrequency images via continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Secondly, CCT-GAN is designed to achieve high-quality fake data generation and compound fault diagnosis modelling without large computational costs. Thirdly, the relation between a single fault and the compound fault is considered in the compound fault diagnosis modelling via multi-hot representation to alleviate the data imbalance issue. An experimental study based on the real-world compound fault dataset of industrial robots reveals that the proposed CCT-GAN shows merits in compound fault diagnosis modelling in comparison with the prevailing algorithms.

To address this issue, we propose a bearing fault diagnosis method utilizing diffusion model data enhancement in this study. Following data collection, we employ the continuous wavelet transform to convert various one-dimensional vibration data into two-dimensional time series graphs. Subsequently, these feature graphs are partitioned into sets of fault samples. Then, the diffusion model is employed to augment the training samples. These augmented samples are then fed into the convolutional neural network for fault diag­ nosis, and their diagnostic accuracy is compared with that of the original dataset. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the data augmentation technique, founded on the diffusion model, enhances fault diagnosis accuracy within a small sample training dataset. Ultimately, the efficacy of the proposed method is validated utilizing the Paderborn bearing dataset and juxtaposed against alternative data augmentation techniques. The findings indicate that the diffusion model-based data augmentation method outperforms other techniques in terms of both training accuracy and stability, particularly in scenarios with small sample.","2025-01","2024-11-15 16:34:42","2025-05-30 14:04:30","2024-11-15 16:34:42","109520","","","139","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Paper that presents the use of diffusion models to enhance data generation and thus improve fault diagnosis.

First, a feature-aligned multi-scale feature extraction model (MCNN) is designed by analyzing the working principles of convolutional and pooling layers of convolutional neural networks. Secondly, a deep bidirectional mechanism is proposed to better extract the time series features in the process data. This mechanism makes the recurrent neural network not only present the forward processing input features from the past to the future, but also the reverse processing from the future to the past. By integrating these features, the diagnostic performance of the network model is improved. To verify that the proposed model has effective diagnostic accuracy for fault diagnosis, we conduct simulation experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process and a chemical coking furnace, and compare with several conventional network models. In the end, not only the effectiveness of the model is proved, but it is also confirmed that the model is superior to other conventional neural networks in both diagnostic accuracy and feature robustness.","2025-02","2024-11-15 14:57:11","2025-05-30 14:03:38","2024-11-15 14:57:11","120884","","","302","","Chemical Engineering Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Model for anomaly detection and fault diagnosis in chemical process.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive comparative study of state-of-the-art uncertainty-aware DL architectures for fault diagnosis in rotating machinery, where different scenarios affected by epistemic uncertainty and different types of aleatoric uncertainty are investigated. The selected architectures include sampling by dropout, Bayesian neural networks, and deep ensembles. Moreover, to distinguish between in-distribution and OOD data in the different scenarios two uncertainty thresholds, one of which is introduced in this paper, are alternatively applied. Our empirical findings offer guidance to practitioners and researchers who have to deploy real-world uncertainty-aware fault diagnosis systems. In particular, they reveal that, in the presence of epistemic uncertainty, all DL models are capable of effectively detecting, on average, a substantial portion of OOD data across all the scenarios. However, deep ensemble models show superior performance, independently of the uncertainty threshold used for discrimination. In the presence of aleatoric uncertainty, the noise level plays an important role. Specifically, low noise levels hinder the models’ ability to effectively detect OOD data. Even in this case, however, deep ensemble models exhibit a milder degradation in performance, dominating the others. These achievements, combined with their shorter inference time, make deep ensemble architectures the preferred choice.","2024-12-25","2025-05-30 15:45:41","2025-05-31 10:41:44","2025-05-30 15:45:41","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2412.18980 [cs]","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Fault classification paper using CWRU.

Most existing studies assume that the collected health state categories from different operating modes are identical. However, in real industrial scenarios, these categories typically exhibit only partial overlap. The incompleteness of the available data and the large distributional differences between the operating modes pose a significant challenge to existing fault diagnosis methods. To address this problem, a novel fault diagnosis model named self-adaptive temporal-spatial attention network (TSA-SAN) is proposed. First, inter-mode mappings are constructed using healthy category data to generate multimode samples. To enrich the diversity of the fault data, interpolation is performed between healthy and fault samples. Subsequently, the fault diagnosis model is trained using real and generated data. The self-adaptive instance normalization is established to suppress irrelevant information while retaining essential statistical features for diagnosis. In addition, a temporal-spatial attention mechanism is constructed to focus on the key features, thus enhancing the generalization ability of the model. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available on Github at https://github.com/GuangqiangLi/TSA-SAN.","2025-05-16","2025-05-30 15:45:46","2025-05-31 10:28:51","2025-05-30 15:45:46","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2505.11083 [cs]","Comment: 31 pages, 11 figures; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Paper on Fault Diagnosis leveraging self-attention with normal and fault data with also real and synthetic data.
