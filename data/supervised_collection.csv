Faulty data samples are usually more difficult for collection than normal operation data. Existing works show that the generative adversarial networks (GAN) are useful generating synthetic faulty data samples to enrich the training dataset. However, it remains a problem for the automated FDD applications to select high-quality synthetic faulty samples generated by GAN. The FDD accuracy becomes unstable when the quality of synthetic fault data samples cannot be controlled entirely. In this study, we proposed to use the classic definition of anomaly detection to select high-quality synthetic fault data samples with the generative adversarial networks. Two anomaly detection methods were investigated, including the traditional variational auto-encoder (VAE) and the GANomaly. Through a series of experiments, it is justified that, with a small amount of real fault data, the proposed GANbased chiller FDD framework with GANomaly achieves the highest FDD accuracy than all compared methods.","2021-08","2024-03-06 13:05:01","2024-05-22 00:34:40","2024-03-06 13:05:01","107982","","","201","","Building and Environment","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p>Uses GAN and VAE to generate synthetic fault data.

The vast majority of past research has focused on signal processing and spectral analysis for fault diagnostics in rotating components. In this study, a data mining approach using a machine learning technique called anomaly detection (AD) is presented. This method employs classiﬁcation techniques to discriminate between defect examples. Two features, kurtosis and Non-Gaussianity Score (NGS), are extracted to develop anomaly detection algorithms. The performance of the developed algorithms was examined through real data from a test to failure bearing.

The samples of known fault type are categorized and the samples of unknown fault type are clustered with this approach. To determine the performance and possible advantages of the approaches, the experiments on ball bearing fault data and Iris data were performed. Results show that our proposed approach outperforms the other methods, when the training samples are inadequate to cover all of the fault types.

Therefore, in order to facilitate the practical application of a deep learning model in bearing fault diagnosis, a vibration–speed fusion network is proposed, which utilizes a transformer with a self-attention module to extract vibration features and utilizes a sparse autoencoder (SAE) network to extract sparse features from speed pulse signal. The vibration–speed fusion network enables the efﬁcient fusion of different signals in a high-dimensional vector space with a high degree of model interpretability, without additional signal processing steps. After tuning the hyperparameters of the network, the key segments of the bearing’s time-domain vibration signals can be optimally extracted, the network performance is much better than traditional deep learning methods, and the classiﬁcation accuracy can reach 95.18% and 99.85% on the two public bearing datasets from the Xi’an Jiaotong University and the University of Ottawa.","2022-10-18","2024-03-20 16:16:03","2024-03-27 14:34:37","2024-03-20 16:16:03","948","","10","10","","Machines","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 13.3px Arial; -webkit-text-stroke: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'Arial'; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 13.33px; font-kerning: none;"">Fuses an autoencoder with a transformer for bearing fault classification from speed and vibration data.

The health feature space generated by a semi-supervised autoencoder (SSAE) not only identiﬁes normal and thermal/electrical fault types, but also presents the underlying characteristics of DGA. In the proposed approach, by adding an auxiliary task that detects normal and fault states in the loss function of SSAE, the health feature space additionally enables visualization of health degradation properties. The overall procedure of the new approach includes three key steps: 1) preprocessing DGA data, 2) extracting two health features via SAAT, and 3) visualizing the two health features in two-dimensional space. In this paper, we test the proposed approach using massive unlabeled/labeled Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) databases and IEC TC 10 databases. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, four comparative studies are conducted with these datasets; the studies examined: 1) the effectiveness of an auxiliary detection task, 2) the effectiveness of the visualization method, 3) conventional fault diagnosis methods, and 4) the state-of-the-art, semi-supervised deep learning algorithms. By examining several evaluation metrics, these comparative studies conﬁrm that the proposed approach outperforms SSAE without the auxiliary task, existing methods, and state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms, in terms of deﬁning health degradation performance.

The monitoring system based on IoT technology consists of two parts: a data measurement subsystem and a data reception subsystem. Firstly, transformer vibration signals are measured by using the data measurement subsystem, and they are sent to the remote server by using the data reception subsystem. Then, an EML composed of deep belief networks (DBNs) and stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAs) with different activation functions, and relevance vector machines (RVMs) is proposed. DBNs and SDAs are respectively used to extract features from the signals, and RVMs are respectively employed as classifier. In order to ensure efficient of the EML, a novel combination strategy is proposed. A transformer fault diagnosis experiment is performed, and the diagnosis results confirm that the designed monitoring system can collect vibration signals effectively and long-distance, and the proposed EML can usefully remedy the inadequate information of features extracted by individual deep learning method, and its RVM classifier is obviously better than other commonly used classifiers.","2020-07","2024-03-20 16:15:41","2024-07-03 14:02:58","2024-03-20 16:15:41","533-545","","","108","","Future Generation Computer Systems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","; /Users/Adri/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-adria.molero@upc.edu/Mi unidad/Zotero/storage/IHX98G9C/Zhang et al. - 2020 - Transformer fault diagnosis method using IoT based.pdf","notion://www.notion.so/Zhang-et-al-2020-edbe83317bfb41e8a64a0e2cdbcdc18e","Anomaly detection; Fault classification; notion; 1D input; Classified; Read; PCA visualization; DBN","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, fault types keep increasing with the change in the working state of mechanical equipment in practical scenarios, which causes the performance of traditional machine-learning models to degrade rapidly. Incremental learning can continuously learn new knowledge from incremental information while retaining previously learned knowledge, effectively enhancing the generalization performance of the model to meet the needs of fault diagnosis in actual industrial scenarios. Moreover, the noise environment will have a certain effect on the performance of the model. Therefore, this article proposes a new incremental learning method using classification and feature-level information, which aims to improve the robustness of the model under noisy conditions. First, an adaptive dual-branch residual network is constructed, and weights are assigned through an adaptive algorithm to enable the model to retain old knowledge while learning new knowledge. Then, an adversarial network is used to reduce the differences at the feature level after the samples pass through the model of different phases, which ensures the sustainable learning ability of the model and promotes knowledge transfer between different phases. Meanwhile, catastrophic forgetting is overcome through knowledge distillation loss. The comparative experimental results show that the proposed method in this article outperforms the current popular incremental learning method.","2024","2024-03-20 16:05:32","2024-05-01 18:04:29","2024-03-20 16:05:32","1-14","","","73","","IEEE Trans.

They do, however, rely on large amounts of accurately labeled data. It is challenging to accurately label incipient or secondary fault signals in the presence of operational background noise, resulting in noisy labels. This study presents a bidirectional guidance method that enables deep networks to diagnose faults robustly with the ability to label noise tolerance. First, the proposed method uses discrete wavelet packet transform (DWPT) to preprocess vibration signals before feeding them into the deep convolutional network. Second, a bidirectional loss (BL) function is proposed to significantly improve the robustness of the model in the case of noisy labels. Third, a fast cosine decay (FCD) strategy of the learning rate is designed to further boost the recognition performance of the model under severe noisy labels. The proposed method is applied to testbed experiments and wind turbine fault diagnosis.

At present, an intelligent fault diagnosis method based on deep learning has been widely applied in mechanical areas due to its strong ability of feature extraction and accurate identiﬁcation. However, it often depends on enough training samples. Generally, the model performance depends on sufﬁcient training samples. However, the fault data are always insufﬁcient in practical engineering as the mechanical equipment often works under normal conditions, resulting in imbalanced data. Deep learning-based models trained directly with the imbalanced data will greatly reduce the diagnosis accuracy. In this paper, a diagnosis method is proposed to address the imbalanced data problem and enhance the diagnosis accuracy. Firstly, signals from multiple sensors are processed by the wavelet transform to enhance data features, which are then squeezed and fused through pooling and splicing operations. Subsequently, improved adversarial networks are constructed to generate new samples for data augmentation. Finally, an improved residual network is constructed by introducing the convolutional block attention module for enhancing the diagnosis performance. The experiments containing two different types of bearing datasets are adopted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in single-class and multi-class data imbalance cases. The results show that the proposed method can generate high-quality synthetic samples and improve the diagnosis accuracy presenting great potential in imbalanced fault diagnosis.","2023-02-24","2024-04-17 15:24:49","2024-08-09 15:16:01","2024-04-17 15:24:49","2542","","5","23","","Sensors","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Fault diagnosis method that first preprocesses with a CWT to move from time series to images, then fuses all sensors signals with avg pooling and then trains a GAN to solve imbalance issue and finally performs fault classification using a CNN with attention module.

To address the problem of poor fault classification accuracy of rotating equipment, this paper proposes a new solution to deploy a composite fault diagnosis model at the front end to achieve low power consumption, continuous automatic identification and monitoring of equipment faults. We creatively combined the idea of speech recognition to solve the problem that traditional feature extraction methods are insufficient in handling composite fault diagnosis when dealing with fault waveform files, and used Fbank speech feature extraction idea to extract fault features, thus simplifying the complex fault diagnosis problem into an image classification problem. The generated composite fault Fbank feature data set is significantly different in visual observation. Therefore, we further designed the LeNet-F network based on the LeNet network for composite fault diagnosis. The model was validated on the K210 development board to achieve an accuracy of 97.41% for hybrid fault classification at a model size of 2.4MB.

These sensors record the internal state of a machine, the external environment, and the interaction of machines with other machines and humans. It is of prime importance to leverage this information in order to minimize downtime of machines, or even avoid downtime completely by constant monitoring. Since each device generates a different type of streaming data, it is normally the case that a speciﬁc kind of anomaly detection technique performs better than the others depending on the data type. For some types of data and use-cases, statistical anomaly detection techniques work better, whereas for others, deep learning-based techniques are preferred. In this paper, we present a novel anomaly detection technique, FuseAD, which takes advantage of both statistical and deep-learning-based approaches by fusing them together in a residual fashion. The obtained results show an increase in area under the curve (AUC) as compared to state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when FuseAD is tested on a publicly available dataset (Yahoo Webscope benchmark). The obtained results advocate that this fusion-based technique can obtain the best of both worlds by combining their strengths and complementing their weaknesses.

When defective, sensors either stop communicating or convey incorrect information. These unsteady situations threaten the safety, economy, and reliability of a system. The objective of this study is to construct a lightweight machine learning-based fault detection and diagnostic system within the limited energy resources, memory, and computation of a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In this paper, a ContextAware Fault Diagnostic (CAFD) scheme is proposed based on an ensemble learning algorithm called Extra-Trees. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, a realistic WSN scenario composed of humidity and temperature sensor observations is replicated with extreme low-intensity faults. Six commonly occurring types of sensor fault are considered: drift, hard-over/bias, spike, erratic/precision degradation, stuck, and data-loss. The proposed CAFD scheme reveals the ability to accurately detect and diagnose low-intensity sensor faults in a timely manner.

However, target data may be inaccessible in the model training phase, resulting in the degradation or failure of the diagnosis model. Therefore, this paper introduces a new idea called cross-domain augmentation (CDA) to achieve diagnosis under unseen working conditions, which are frequently occurred in industrial scenarios. To realize this idea, an adversarial domainaugmented generalization (ADAG) method is proposed with domain augmentation via convex combination of data and feature-label pairs. Through adversarial training on multi-source domains and the augmented domain, ADAG enables learning generalized and augmented features, which are proximal representation in the unseen domain, facilitating the generalization ability of the model. Moreover, feature extractor and domain classifier are optimized as adversaries in model training to obtain domain-invariant features, while the fault classifier is trained to identify the features. Extensive experiment studies indicate that ADAG can successfully solve the crossdomain diagnosis problem under unseen working conditions. For SDUST case study, ADAG promotes the model accuracy by 1.44%; while for a more challenging Ottawa case study, it promotes the model accuracy by 5.34%. Moreover, the domain discrepancy is reduced by 4.6%.","2023-06","2024-06-28 16:45:36","2024-08-01 18:50:34","2024-06-28 16:45:36","109171","","","234","","Reliability Engineering & System Safety","Cross-domain augmentation diagnosis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #1f1f1f; -webkit-text-stroke: #1f1f1f; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 12.00px; font-kerning: none;"">Uses GAN-like approach to augment fault data for better fault diagnosis on unseen working conditions to avoid giving false positives on fault diagnosis due to only being in different unseen conditions</span></p>","/Users/Adri/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-adria.molero@upc.edu/Mi unidad/Zotero/storage/GGBPP9EA/Li et al. - 2023 - Cross-domain augmentation diagnosis An adversaria.pdf; ","notion://www.notion.so/Li-et-al-2023-4ace4c831cbe4966b82653dfc5fcef0d","Deep Learning; Fault classification; Latent space; notion; Data handling techniques; 1D input; Classified; Read; GAN; Processed data; t-SNE visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among these studies, the methods based on artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are commonly used, which employ signal processing techniques for extracting features and further input the features to ANNs for classifying faults. Though these methods did work in intelligent fault diagnosis of rotating machinery, they still have two deﬁciencies. (1) The features are manually extracted depending on much prior knowledge about signal processing techniques and diagnostic expertise. In addition, these manual features are extracted according to a speciﬁc diagnosis issue and probably unsuitable for other issues. (2) The ANNs adopted in these methods have shallow architectures, which limits the capacity of ANNs to learn the complex non-linear relationships in fault diagnosis issues. As a breakthrough in artiﬁcial intelligence, deep learning holds the potential to overcome the aforementioned deﬁciencies. Through deep learning, deep neural networks (DNNs) with deep architectures, instead of shallow ones, could be established to mine the useful information from raw data and approximate complex non-linear functions. Based on DNNs, a novel intelligent method is proposed in this paper to overcome the deﬁciencies of the aforementioned intelligent diagnosis methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using datasets from rolling element bearings and planetary gearboxes. These datasets contain massive measured signals involving different health conditions under various operating conditions. The diagnosis results show that the proposed method is able to not only adaptively mine available fault characteristics from the measured signals, but also obtain superior diagnosis accuracy compared with the existing methods.","2016-05","2024-06-28 16:33:09","2025-05-25 11:29:02","2024-06-28 16:33:09","303-315","","","72-73","","Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing","Deep neural networks","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 12.0px Helvetica; color: #1f1f1f; -webkit-text-stroke: #1f1f1f; background-color: #ffffff;""><span style=""font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-size: 12.00px; font-kerning: none;"">A bit old paper but good theory on how to apply NN (autoencoder arch) for fault diagnosis.

However, ensuring product quality is critical to the success of the FDM manufacturing process because defects can occur owing to various factors. An effective diagnosis facilitates timely corrective measures, thus enhancing quality control significantly. Although vision-based deep learning diagnostic methods have shown encouraging results, they do not take the autocorrelation of defective pixels resulting from layer-by-layer accumulation into account. The existing models do not fully utilize spatiotemporal correlations, thus resulting in limited diagnostic accuracy under certain circumstances. Hence, a time-series vision Transformer is proposed for the drifting process parameters that considers the spatiotemporal characteristics of the acquired data. In this approach, raw layer-wise images are decomposed and integrated into image streams containing temporal and spatial information. A Transformer network with cross space-time attention is adopted to extract spatiotemporal features from constructed image streams. A laboratory experiment is conducted to verify the effectiveness of our model. The overall framework not only achieves higher accuracy of 90.8 %, but also demonstrates better generalizability for different parameter drifts compared with traditional and state-of-the-art algorithms.

In particular, analyzing vibration data offers great potential to extract meaningful insights into predictive maintenance by the detection of bearing faults. Deep learning can be a powerful method to predict these mechanical failures; however, they lack generalizability to new tasks or datasets and require expensive, labeled mechanical data. We address this by presenting a novel self-supervised pretraining and fine-tuning framework based on transformer models. In particular, we investigate different tokenization and data augmentation strategies to reach state-of-the-art accuracies using transformer models. Furthermore, we demonstrate self-supervised masked pretraining for vibration signals and its application to low-data regimes, task adaptation, and dataset adaptation. Pretraining is able to improve performance on scarce, unseen training samples, as well as when fine-tuning on fault classes outside of the pretraining distribution. Furthermore, pretrained transformers are shown to be able to generalize to a different dataset in a few-shot manner. This introduces a new paradigm where models can be pretrained on unlabeled data from different bearings, faults, and machinery and quickly deployed to new, data-scarce applications to suit specific manufacturing needs.","2024","2024-12-16 12:03:12","2025-04-25 18:30:56","2024-12-16 12:03:12","70719-70728","","","12","","IEEE Access","FaultFormer","","","","","","","en","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv:2312.02380 [cs]","Comment: 10 pages, 6 figures; <div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Great paper and similar to our task.

To optimize the structure of existing transformer-like methods and improve the diagnostic accuracy, we proposed a novel method based on the multiscale time-frequency sparse transformer (MTFST) in this paper. First, a novel tokenizer based on shot-time Fourier transform (STFT) is designed, which processes the 1D format raw signals into 2D format discrete time-frequency sequences in the embedding space. Second, a sparse self-attention mechanism is designed to eliminate the feature mapping defect in naive self-attention mechanism. Then, the novel encoder-decoder structure is presented, the multiple encoders are employed to extract the hidden feature of different time-frequency sequences obtained by STFT with different window widths, and the decoder is used to remap the deep information and connect to the classifier for discriminating fault types. The proposed method is tested in the XJTU-SY bearing dataset and self-made experiment rig dataset, and the following work is conducted. The influences of hyperparameters on diagnosis accuracy and number of parameters are analysed in detail. The weights of the attention mechanism (AM) are visualized and analysed to study the interpretability, which explains the partly working pattern of the network. In the comparison test with other existing CNN, RNN, and transformer models, the diagnosis accuracy of different methods is statistically analysed, feature vectors are presented via the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) method, and the proposed MTFST obtains the best accuracy and feature distribution form. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in bearing fault diagnosis.","2023-08-04","2024-12-16 12:03:02","2025-05-01 14:54:21","2024-12-16 12:03:02","1-21","","","2023","","Shock and Vibration","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>This paper proposes how a transformer architecture for fault diagnosis (classification) in bearings vibration data.

In the current Industry 4.0 framework, maintenance strategies based on traditional data-driven fault diagnosis schemes require enhanced capabilities to be applied over modern production systems. In fact, the integration of multiple mechanical components, the consideration of multiple operating conditions, and the appearance of combined fault patterns due to eventual multi-fault scenarios lead to complex electromechanical systems requiring advanced monitoring strategies. In this regard, data fusion schemes supported with advanced deep learning technology represent a promising approach towards a big data paradigm using cloud-based software services. However, the deep learning models’ structure and hyper-parameters selection represent the main limitation when applied. Thus, in this paper, a novel deep-learning-based methodology for fault diagnosis in electromechanical systems is presented. The main beneﬁts of the proposed methodology are the easiness of application and high adaptability to available data.

Accurate compound fault diagnosis is essential to the safe operation of industrial robots, while it is challenging to achieve since the compound fault samples are hard to be collected. Generative adversarial network (GAN) is a useful tool for addressing the data imbalance issue. However, the computation efficiency of GAN in addressing the data imbalance issue has not been investigated. Hence, this study proposes a lightweight GAN named compact con­ volutional Transformers-GAN (CCT-GAN) to alleviate the data imbalance issue in compound fault diagnosis modelling. Firstly, the feedback current signals collected from the industrial robot are transformed into timefrequency images via continuous wavelet transformation (CWT). Secondly, CCT-GAN is designed to achieve high-quality fake data generation and compound fault diagnosis modelling without large computational costs. Thirdly, the relation between a single fault and the compound fault is considered in the compound fault diagnosis modelling via multi-hot representation to alleviate the data imbalance issue. An experimental study based on the real-world compound fault dataset of industrial robots reveals that the proposed CCT-GAN shows merits in compound fault diagnosis modelling in comparison with the prevailing algorithms. The results indicate that CCTGAN can performance of compound fault diagnosis when only 100 data samples from each compound fault category are available.","2024-12","2024-11-15 16:34:32","2024-12-01 11:15:19","2024-11-15 16:34:32","109315","","","138","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""8""><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0)""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255)"">Approach to compound fault diagnosis on industrial robots (were faults are typically transferred) using GAN to address the imbalance issue.

Then IEC three ratios data is normalized to reduce data singularity and improve training speed. Secondly, deep belief network is established by two layers of CSAE and one layer of back propagation (BP) network. Thirdly, CSAE is adopted to unsupervised training and getting features.

However, collecting sufficient failure data proves challenging in real-world industrial environments due to their complexity. Owing to this constraint, the majority of current methods fail to accurately identify fault types with limited data, thereby impeding timely maintenance efforts. To address this issue, we propose a bearing fault diagnosis method utilizing diffusion model data enhancement in this study. Following data collection, we employ the continuous wavelet transform to convert various one-dimensional vibration data into two-dimensional time series graphs. Subsequently, these feature graphs are partitioned into sets of fault samples. Then, the diffusion model is employed to augment the training samples. These augmented samples are then fed into the convolutional neural network for fault diag­ nosis, and their diagnostic accuracy is compared with that of the original dataset. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the data augmentation technique, founded on the diffusion model, enhances fault diagnosis accuracy within a small sample training dataset. Ultimately, the efficacy of the proposed method is validated utilizing the Paderborn bearing dataset and juxtaposed against alternative data augmentation techniques. The findings indicate that the diffusion model-based data augmentation method outperforms other techniques in terms of both training accuracy and stability, particularly in scenarios with small sample.","2025-01","2024-11-15 16:34:42","2025-03-02 11:24:17","2024-11-15 16:34:42","109520","","","139","","Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","<div data-schema-version=""9""><p>Paper that presents the use of diffusion models to enhance data generation and thus improve fault diagnosis.

Secondly, a deep bidirectional mechanism is proposed to better extract the time series features in the process data. This mechanism makes the recurrent neural network not only present the forward processing input features from the past to the future, but also the reverse processing from the future to the past. By integrating these features, the diagnostic performance of the network model is improved. To verify that the proposed model has effective diagnostic accuracy for fault diagnosis, we conduct simulation experiments on the Tennessee-Eastman (TE) process and a chemical coking furnace, and compare with several conventional network models.
