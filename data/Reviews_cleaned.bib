 abstract = {In the last years, the rotating systems condition based maintenance field has been received focus from both academic and industry sector. This is due to the great relevance of these systems in the industrial sector, especially for production and manufacturing processes. To guarantee the high efficiency, safety and correct performance of the different components that can form a rotating system, such as motors, bearings, gearboxes and shafts, it is essential to have monitoring systems, schemes and methodologies with the ability to diagnose and detect malfunctions on them. However, monitoring schemes present great challenges in dealing with the complexity these of systems, that implies a working environment subject to different operation condition, configurations with multiple components and the presence of faults of different nature, i.e., mechanical, electrical, electromagnetic, under isolated or combined scenarios. Recently, artificial intelligent-based techniques have been widely used in monitoring schemes, especially artificial neural networks. Due to its great capacity for characterization and feature extraction, an effort has been made to study methodologies based on these techniques. In addition, multi-layered architectures, known as deep neural networks, represent a considerable advance in the field of pattern recognition. However, the implementation of these schemes in industrial environments still presents a continuous challenge due to the requirements, such as high reliability, robustness and scalability that must be accomplish, especially in the new Industry 4.0 paradigm.},

 abstract = {The recent wave of digitalization is characterized by the widespread deployment of sensors in many different environments, e.g., multi-sensor systems represent a critical enabling technology towards full autonomy in industrial scenarios. Sensors usually produce vast amounts of unlabeled data in the form of multivariate time series that may capture normal conditions or anomalies. Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (MTSAD), i.e., the ability to identify normal or irregular operative conditions of a system through the analysis of data from multiple sensors, is crucial in many fields. However, MTSAD is challenging due to the need for simultaneous analysis of temporal (intrasensor) patterns and spatial (inter-sensor) dependencies. Unfortunately, labeling massive amounts of data is practically impossible in many real-world situations of interest (e.g., the reference ground truth may not be available or the amount of data may exceed labeling capabilities); therefore, robust unsupervised MTSAD is desirable. Recently, advanced techniques in machine learning and signal processing, including deep learning methods, have been developed for unsupervised MTSAD. In this article, we provide an extensive review of the current state of the art with a theoretical background about multivariate time-series anomaly detection. A detailed numerical evaluation of 13 promising algorithms on two publicly available multivariate time-series datasets is presented, with advantages and shortcomings highlighted.},

 abstract = {In order to evaluate final quality, nondestructive testing techniques for finding bearing flaws have grown in favor. The precision of image processing-based vision-based technology has greatly improved for defect identification, inspection, and classification. Deep Transfer Learning (DTL), a kind of machine learning, combines the superiority of Transfer Learning (TL) for knowledge transfer with the benefits of Deep Learning (DL) for feature representation. As a result, the discipline of Intelligent Fault Diagnosis has extensively developed and researched DTL approaches. They can improve the robustness, reliability, and usefulness of DL-based fault diagnosis techniques (IFD). IFD has been the subject of several thorough and excellent studies, although most of them have appraised important research from an algorithmic standpoint, neglecting real-world applications. DTL-based IFD strategies have also not yet undergone a full evaluation. It is necessary and imperative to go through the relevant DTL-based IFD publications in light of this. Readers will be able to grasp the most cutting-edge concepts and develop practical solutions to any IFD challenges they may encounter by doing this. The theory behind DTL is briefly discussed before describing how transfer learning algorithms may be included into deep learning models. This research study looks at a number of vision-based methods for defect detection and identification utilizing vibration acoustic sensor data. The goal of this review is to assess where vision inspection system research is right now. In this respect, image processing as well as deep learning, machine learning, transfer learning, few-shot learning, and light-weight approach and its selection were explored. This review addresses the creation of defect classifiers and vision-based fault detection systems.},

 abstract = {The pervasive digital innovation of the last decades has led to a remarkable transformation of maintenance strategies. The data collected from machinery and the extraction of valuable information through machine learning (ML) have assumed a crucial role. As a result, data-driven predictive maintenance (PdM) has received significant attention from academics and industries. However, practical issues are limiting the implementation of PdM in manufacturing plants. These issues are related to the availability, quantity, and completeness of the collected data, which do not contain all machinery health conditions, are often unprovided with the contextual information needed by ML models, and are huge in terms of gigabytes per minute. As an extension of previous work by the authors, this paper aims to validate the methodology for streaming fault and novelty detection that reduces the quantity of data to transfer and store, allows the automatic collection of contextual information, and recognizes novel system behaviors. Five distinct datasets are collected from the field, and results show that streaming and incremental clustering-based approaches are effective tools for obtaining labeled datasets and real-time feedback on the machinery's health condition.},

 abstract = {Purpose{\enspace} This article aims to systematically review the recent research advances in data-driven machinery fault diagnosis based on machine learning algorithms, and provide valuable guidance for future research directions in this field. Methods{\enspace} This article reviews the research results of data-driven fault diagnosis methods of recent years, and it includes the application status and research progress of machinery fault diagnosis in three frameworks: shallow machine learning (SML), deep learning (DL), and transfer learning (TL). Many publications on this topic are classified and summarized. The related theories, application research, advantages, and disadvantages of several main algorithms under each framework are discussed. Results{\enspace} It has shown that SML-based diagnosis models are simple, reliable, and fast to train. For relatively uncomplicated systems, SML-based diagnosis models still have important applications. For diagnosis tasks with large amounts of training samples and the pursuit of higher accuracy, DL-based diagnosis models can provide end-to-end diagnostic services for complex systems as well as compound faults. TL-based diagnosis models can realize knowledge transfer across conditions, machines, and even fields to solve the problems of data scarcity and sample imbalance that often occur in fault diagnosis. However, in the face of increasingly complex engineering systems, the applications of machine learning algorithms in machinery fault diagnosis are still challenging. Conclusions{\enspace} In future research, the fusion of different machine learning frameworks could solve the problems of inadequate feature extraction and slow training of diagnostic models. Transformer neural network based on pure attention mechanism breaks through the shortcomings of LSTM neural network which cannot be computed in parallel, and it is a worthy research direction in the field of fault diagnosis. In addition, machinery fault diagnosis method based on machine learning algorithms also has great potential for improvement in transferability, federated transfer learning, and strong noise background. These proposed future research directions can provide new ideas for researchers to promote the development of machine learning algorithms in machinery fault diagnosis.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

 abstract = {With the Internet of Things (IoT) devices becoming an integral part of human life, the need for robust anomaly detection in streaming data has also been elevated. Dozens of distance-based, density-based, kernel-based, and cluster-based algorithms have been proposed in the area of anomaly detection. Recently, because of the robustness of the deep neural networks (DNN), different deep learning-based anomaly detection methods have also been proposed. With all these rapid developments, there exists a small number of comparative studies for anomaly detection methods. Even in those studies, the comparison is done only in typical anomaly detection settings without taking the streaming data into consideration. The presence of intrinsic time-series characteristics like trend, seasonality, and changepoint makes it important to study the behavior of commonly used anomaly detection methods on streaming data. Moreover, the comparison of traditional methods with deep learning-based methods also brings exciting insights about the data which are generally overlooked by traditional methods. In this study, we compare 13 anomaly detection methods on two commonly used streaming data sets. We used four different evaluation metrics to evaluate the methods from different perspectives. Our analysis reveals that the deep learning-based anomaly detection methods are superior to traditional anomaly detection methods.},

The survey reveals that most existing work utilized deep learning to conduct feature learning from unstructured raw data including vibration data, current signals, images and videos. Deep learning provides a general framework for PHM applications: fault detection uses either reconstruction error or stacks a binary classier on top of the network to detect anomalies; fault diagnosis typically adds a soft-max layer to perform multi-class classification; and prognosis adds a continuous regression layer to predict remaining useful life.

 abstract = {In the field of Prognostics and Health Management (PHM), recent years have witnessed a significant surge in the application of machine learning (ML). Despite this growth, the field grapples with a lack of unified guidelines and systematic approaches for effectively implementing these ML techniques and comprehensive analysis regarding industrial open-source data across varied scenarios. To address these gaps, this paper provides a comprehensive review of machine learning approaches for diagnostics and prognostics of industrial systems using opensource datasets from PHM Data Challenge Competitions held between 2018 and 2023 by PHM Society and IEEE Reliability Society and summarizes a unified ML framework. This review systematically categorizes and scrutinizes the problems, challenges, methodologies, and advancements demonstrated in these competitions, highlighting the evolving role of both conventional machine learning and deep learning in tackling complex industrial tasks related to detection, diagnosis, assessment, and prognosis. Moreover, this paper delves into the common challenges in PHM data challenge competitions by emphasizing both data-related and model-related issues and summarizes the solutions that have been employed to address these challenges. Finally, we identify key themes and potential directions for future research, providing opportunities and prospects for ML further development in PHM.},

 abstract = {Vibration measurement and monitoring are essential in a wide variety of applications. Vibration measurements are critical for diagnosing industrial machinery malfunctions because they provide information about the condition of the rotating equipment. Vibration analysis is considered the most effective method for predictive maintenance because it is used to troubleshoot instantaneous faults as well as periodic maintenance. Numerous studies conducted in this vein have been published in a variety of outlets. This review documents data-driven and recently published deep learning techniques for vibration-based condition monitoring. Numerous studies were obtained from two reputable indexing databases, Web of Science and Scopus. Following a thorough review, 59 studies were selected for synthesis. The selected studies are then systematically discussed to provide researchers with an in-depth view of deep learning-based fault diagnosis methods based on vibration signals. Additionally, a few remarks regarding future research directions are made, including graph-based neural networks, physics-informed ML, and a transformer convolutional network-based fault diagnosis method.},

@article{venkatasubramanianReviewProcessFault2003,
 abstract = {Fault detection and diagnosis is an important problem in process engineering. It is the central component of abnormal event management (AEM) which has attracted a lot of attention recently. AEM deals with the timely detection, diagnosis and correction of abnormal conditions of faults in a process. Early detection and diagnosis of process faults while the plant is still operating in a controllable region can help avoid abnormal event progression and reduce productivity loss. Since the petrochemical industries lose an estimated 20 billion dollars every year, they have rated AEM as their number one problem that needs to be solved. Hence, there is considerable interest in this field now from industrial practitioners as well as academic researchers, as opposed to a decade or so ago. There is an abundance of literature on process fault diagnosis ranging from analytical methods to artificial intelligence and statistical approaches. From a modelling perspective, there are methods that require accurate process models, semi-quantitative models, or qualitative models. At the other end of the spectrum, there are methods that do not assume any form of model information and rely only on historic process data. In addition, given the process knowledge, there are different search techniques that can be applied to perform diagnosis. Such a collection of bewildering array of methodologies and alternatives often poses a difficult challenge to any aspirant who is not a specialist in these techniques. Some of these ideas seem so far apart from one another that a non-expert researcher or practitioner is often left wondering about the suitability of a method for his or her diagnostic situation. While there have been some excellent reviews in this field in the past, they often focused on a particular branch, such as analytical models, of this broad discipline. The basic aim of this three part series of papers is to provide a systematic and comparative study of various diagnostic methods from different perspectives. We broadly classify fault diagnosis methods into three general categories and review them in three parts. They are quantitative model-based methods, qualitative model-based methods, and process history based methods. In the first part of the series, the problem of fault diagnosis is introduced and approaches based on quantitative models are reviewed. In the remaining two parts, methods based on qualitative models and process history data are reviewed. Furthermore, these disparate methods will be compared and evaluated based on a common set of criteria introduced in the first part of the series. We conclude the series with a discussion on the relationship of fault diagnosis to other process operations and on emerging trends such as hybrid blackboard-based frameworks for fault diagnosis.},

@article{yanComprehensiveSurveyDeep2024,
 abstract = {Automating the monitoring of industrial processes has the potential to enhance efficiency and optimize quality by promptly detecting abnormal events and thus facilitating timely interventions. Deep learning, with its capacity to discern non-trivial patterns within large datasets, plays a pivotal role in this process. Standard deep learning methods are suitable to solve a specific task given a specific type of data. During training, deep learning demands large volumes of labeled data. However, due to the dynamic nature of the industrial processes and environment, it is impractical to acquire large-scale labeled data for standard deep learning training for every slightly different case anew. Deep transfer learning offers a solution to this problem. By leveraging knowledge from related tasks and accounting for variations in data distributions, the transfer learning framework solves new tasks with little or even no additional labeled data. The approach bypasses the need to retrain a model from scratch for every new setup and dramatically reduces the labeled data requirement. This survey first provides an in-depth review of deep transfer learning, examining the problem settings of transfer learning and classifying the prevailing deep transfer learning methods. Moreover, we delve into applications of deep transfer learning in the context of a broad spectrum of time series anomaly detection tasks prevalent in primary industrial domains, e.g., manufacturing process monitoring, predictive maintenance, energy management, and infrastructure facility monitoring. We discuss the challenges and limitations of deep transfer learning in industrial contexts and conclude the survey with practical directions and actionable suggestions to address the need to leverage diverse time series data for anomaly detection in an increasingly dynamic production environment.},

@inproceedings{yangReviewFaultDiagnosis2023,
 abstract = {In the last few years, mechanical fault diagnosis (FD) based on deep learning has been systematically applied to various industrial fields. However, most methods rely on enough labeled data, but collecting enough sample of failure is timeconsuming and labor-intensive. It remains challenging to train a model for FD with numbered training data and to function correctly under intricate operating scenario. In response to this problem, the FD method based on Siamese neural network (SNN) has shown promising results in recent years, especially in the case of insufficient training samples; the fault diagnosis work has achieved good results and has been widely concerned by researchers at domestic and foreign. To better combine the SNN for fault diagnosis and give full play to the advantages of the SNN in fault diagnosis, this paper summarizes and analyzes the fault diagnosis methods based on SNN. Firstly, the basic framework of the SNN method is introduced, and the advantages and application scenarios of the framework are pointed out. Secondly, the existing fault diagnosis methods based on SNN are classified, including the principle of the technique, improved methods, and shortcomings. Finally, the FD methods based on SNN are summarized, and the development of the SNN in FD is in prospect.},

 abstract = {Since 2006, deep learning (DL) has become a rapidly growing research direction, redefining state-of-the-art performances in a wide range of areas such as object recognition, image segmentation, speech recognition and machine translation. In modern manufacturing systems, data-driven machine health monitoring is gaining in popularity due to the widespread deployment of low-cost sensors and their connection to the Internet. Meanwhile, deep learning provides useful tools for processing and analyzing these big machinery data. The main purpose of this paper is to review and summarize the emerging research work of deep learning on machine health monitoring. After the brief introduction of deep learning techniques, the applications of deep learning in machine health monitoring systems are reviewed mainly from the following aspects: Auto-encoder (AE) and its variants, Restricted Boltzmann Machines and its variants including Deep Belief Network (DBN) and Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). In addition, an experimental study on the performances of these approaches has been conducted, in which the data and code have been online. Finally, some new trends of DL-based machine health monitoring methods are discussed. {\'O} 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
